looking at a wavecomingin yeah the stakes are High I mean thisis it this is this is the final deal kirPinkerton needs a 14 if she wants to getinto m contention for the F oh Mollypicklum what good job no way no waypresent how was that pump into thatthing how was that look up that headlook up to be like okay here's where I'mat and then that rail pull mly Pim shesaid she's been studying like she saidshe was really frustrated with herbackhand Barrel techniqu so she juststarted watching Benji brand like videosand clips she's like I studied it and Ilearned a technique from watching himand I've been applying it which kind ofsurprises me because you usually seeBenji going left right frontside but I know look at this thing fulldouble up too oh yeah that pump hey thatwas like an MF chopes pump one of thoseand then the claimyeah wow look at this right here doesn'tyank the rail just enough to pull in toride that pick that line lookingwow no okay time to go go out the doorlet's go 20 years old yeah I mean thisisthis sheneeds that claim was was epic herconfidence like she just walks with likethis confidence of like yeah this isme I amme wow that to me that right therewithout I think what makua was saying aswell it may seem very very subtle to theviewer that idea ofum well it just looked like she gotbarreled but a lot of people sometimesforget that in a barrel there's so manylines you can take and you can easily gotoo high or too low and to have thatconfidence to not only change your lineso she goes down she changes her lineand then she holds that line and then rebreaks that line again to straighten outthat's like really Technical and there'sso many nuances when it looks easythat's often times the hardest umdemonstrator it's the highest level ofdifficulty you'll probably see that comeout too in the school hey I'm sure Imeandefinitely judges going to take theirtime but that's going to be that's goingto be a big score out of some possible30 again three judges not unlike yourtraditional um WSL event championshipevent uh where you havefive judges and a high and a low beingthrown out this is just the three judgesgoing one through 10 take their threescores add them up into one score bestobviously being 30 points we see the sunstarting to come out now Shining Lighton the land in theocean look at those buttery conditionsit's like all oily right now dreamsiclesyou can see the plumes of sand startingto move off of The Reef with theNorthwest swell again29.4 for Molly wow wow perfect so that'sthree variations of a nine perhaps thejudge gave a 10 we'll see uh theirindividual scores at some point buthighest score of the comp so farwow and I agree with that that I thinknot like I'm a I mean I'm not a judgeyou know you know what you're talkingabout I think they saw what we saw youknow they saw what we sawCarissa wow okay Carissa no pulled in alittle too deep on that kind of pinchedthat thing kind of came off of TheReef for the size um I don't think thatwas the right anglewave when we when we talk about thecriteria wave selection wave selectionbeing such sokey how do do you pick out the right waywhat are you look what are you lookingfor in a in a in the right wavetoday I mean with the growing swell I Ithink you want those ones that almostlook like those double UPS you knowthose real like either if it's a rightyou want that little kind of hip downthe end where you can see it's going tothrow that extra curtain you can kind ofmaybe race through or just like Molly'sone you know you almost want to see thatfirst section going over and and waitfor that one that's kind of standing upa bit moreum I definitely think they're paying thebigger waves too as the SW as peing youknow probably going to be wanting to gothose ones like Molly just got in yousee sometimes when these on the incomingswell you can see that there's a littleswell in front of this wave coming inthis is very consistent with a a longperiod incoming swell there's a littlebit of a wave in front again it's stilltrying to find that Rhythm thatfrequency from the storm as it movesacross those long distances and acrossthe ocean so they're going to besome swells that are almost stacking ontop of each other just a little bit outof rhythm and that can be a real recipefor disaster when you're taking offyou're taking off into a wave that has alittle wave in front of it and with thelittle bit of sand on the reef um withsand on Shore and this incoming swell uhthe women have the gnarliest conditionsof the day I think um it's going to bethe fast move the longer period alsomeans that the wave's going to be movinga lot faster so it's going to be again alot of late drops um it wouldn't be abad idea to maybe have a little bit morerail to get into ituh Betty Betty yeah having a look atback doorand taking the exit this is a reallystacked heate day I mean I yeah this islike a super heat right here yeah I meanthey're all they're all super Heats yeahwell this onetoo people only need14 11 Kira and Betty Lou 14 and 11respectively that's look you dividethese by three right to get what theyneed midgrade scores scores yeah I meanthat's essentially getting a barrel anybarrel and they're getting throughespecially for Betty Lou and and whatalways seems to be the case and I'm sureyou've experienced this Ka like when youneed a a four as opposed to when youneed an eight and you're coming down tothe back end of a heat it starts to getcan get in your head yeah yeah I feellike that's when you want to kind of tryand get into that Zen Lotus State youknow when you just want to be chillingright out and not letting the bubblstart to Fizz up dud you see Zen butaren't you you're like a like a a zedhead right you're you're heavy metalcalms medown I'm like I'll put some like Slayeron in the morning and just get in aLotus pose and just like totally BlissoutNamaste yeah that's that's my zen Slayerfor the Slayer yoga Ka is teachingSlayer yoga uh consists of a lot ofmoshing that neck ready I heard that youuh had an online bid going for a a DodgeChallenger yeah I'm yeah I'm actuallystill in it right now are you yeah whatyear is it it's a1968 oh yeah oh is this eBay yeah wow ohno Craigslist sorry Craigslist yeahCraigslist where is it sketch list umit's in Kentucky so I'm going to have tofigure out how to get it home it's goingto be a longdrive but it's got the um it's got the440 manual stick shift the hammy yeah ohbig big big boy it's it's got patinait's a bit rough but I like them likethat you know just do you work on youand do you do the work

rightyeah no rust yeah we know yeah that isthat's fantastic I hope you get it yeahI'm fingers crossed all right sick welllet's take a look at how this heat hasgone by here's Betty Lu Sakura Johnsonagain just needing that score of an 11she get pinched on that back door waveuh that's a nice pocket ride I would sayand then the if the turn completed Ithink it would have been a a high scoreMolly's wave though this was thestandard Setter for the day yeah Techthat pump man that pump was amazingcould you imagine Glenn hall right nowon in front of hisscreen look at that thing oh my goodnesshe'd be screamingyeah that's mygirl yeah it seems like uh RIS didn'treally do too much much so far in theheat but I mean she has such a strongstanding right now well you can see allthe sand that's filled up on thosecracks of the reef but what what'sinteresting is now that there's sand inthe cracks of the reef now you can seejust how many caves and holes there areum it's there's a there's a certainregion as you can see that there's aheavy uh cracks groov and Spurs is whatthe coral Community likes to call themuh and it's reallyconcentrated near the pipeline Barrelwhere you can see back door there's nota lot of cracks are filled in with anytypes of sand that's just a flat sectionessentially the closeup Ka just lookedat you like he was like grooving SpursI'm taking that with me groovy band nameor songname please tell me you have a band tooI actually do me and my brother we'reputting out an album inFebruary what are you guys called rightnow I don't really know maybe spinalRevisited

should check out um EddieSuzuki Eddie Suzuki EddieSuzuki he's got some good he's got somegood electric guitar he's uh I thinkfrom the late 70s early ' 80s Hawaiianoh really musici definelycheck out all right 2 minutes and 30seconds to go this is the last chancefor Kira Pinkerton and Betty Luc SakuraJohnson to make this final rememberthere is nopriority no so you can need to getyourself in position as you would uhjust at a regularsession they're holding a pretty tightpack there too yeah and they quitelot of friendships being born right herein this last two minutes bety is is weinto the sameuh back door a she just keeps she'sgetting desperate for it and who knowslike what's happening is is Carissasending her on okay drama let's startthe rumor Mo that's where she needs tojust try and get into that you know thatbut you see Carissa pad P you know likethese are all tactics that you Championsknow how to say oh I'm going to go onthis oh this must be a good one yeah theKumbaya is over as we're trying to makethis final and Carissa is not going togo unless she needs or has a bigopportunity to go she's going to try andforce hands with less than a minuteBetty Lou needingbasically three fours Molly's pumped shejust is like go flat let I did my thingdoesn't look like there's much on thehorizon yeah with it looks pretty flatout there these new swells huh you havethose big LS I feel like and then itjust you get those 15minute pulses butyeah it's going to be maybe one heateveryone I think might get opportunityin their heat but it's only like a oneopportunity to get qualitywaves see some scratching y here with 1012 seconds togo we will Kira or Betty Lou get anopportunity in these lastseconds oh man they willnot damn that wasclose well the strong strong effort putin uh by both kir Pinkerton and BettyLuca Kura Johnson we congratulatethem on their pipe Mastersperformances but for now Carissa moreand Molly Pam and how's that for unfairoh after the horn Betty Lou of coursegetting a back there bar a smash at theend especially when she just needing ina that's almost worse when that happensyou're just like off 20 seconds Lyeah good good showing Betty Lou yeah Kayou

niceuplifting greatenergy moment great energy I you theperfect amount of likenot normal yeah like like Sophie Bellstyle like just the right amount of likeyeah yeah good weird good weird goodweird you need good weird I mean todayyou're going to have to get weird forsure sure cuz it's be a lot of factorslike Mak was saying can you picture himin a big old Hemi leftand drive DodgeChallenger through PirateBay I was going to say Kentucky you likewhat is that thing driving around hereall right well the big question as wehead here into heat 2 this 28 minutes asyou see flies by uh we know thatCarissa and Molly are sitting on the78.9 and a76.90 respectively will it be enough tokeep them in the final as mahina Mahawanted to make that second section asthat pipeline wave ranoff um having a look here Sierra Kerronly needs 11.7 bana cop 12.4 notmuch what a dramatic change to lastyear's uh energy of the women where lastyear it was abit um there's a bit more thinkinghappening with women it seems this yearthere's less thinking more going moregoing yeah yeah they're definitelysending it a lotmore I mean the progress is is is basedin Opportunity we've been talking aboutthat for the entire event you know KKennedy pointed out like that folksmight not understandhow being able to just surf pipelinealone not hassling with 150 people whatthat puts into the memory banks whatthat does for your confidenceyeahand you know obviously we can't we wedon't have the woman's mind so we can'treally speak on behalf of probablywhat's going on we're just um we'realiens to that perspective from the maleperspective looking at it sometimes Ifeel magic happens when the thinkingkind of turns off and the feeling takesover right and the power of of a woman'sthis what women bring to men or or toany that energy thatso so much feeling that they exude intheir person that we're seeing peoplelike M Karissa you know Sierra last yearwhen she got that insane back door wavelike a lot of them you see them like Idon't I I don't know I didn't think Ijust it just happened right and there'ssome magic that is and then able tocarry that forward oh Brianna going overthefalls taking a little heavy one yeahagain there there's going to be thesewaves that are really going to bejacking up on thereef Aron andSierra they kind of seem to be the nextbig thing yeah the the they are thefuture that is now let's take a look atthis uh event format um for those of youmaybe who've missed the last couple ofdays or need a little refresher in thewomen we have 20 Surfers five Heatsthree rounds and we aretaking their three best scores judge onejudge two judge three no four or five nohigh or low those top three waves intoonescore andleaderboard fluctuating as eachcompetitor is essentially competingagainst the rest of the field for that$100,000 that's not that's not smallmoney that's 100 Grand is is literallymore than most professional Surfers in2023 will make total it's it's lifedifference money in the sport ofprofessional surfing uh as the surfindustry has gone through some changesin the last few years the the the moneyis just not lying all over the place soit incredible of Vans to put you knowsuch strong prize money behind uh theVans pipe Masters S A looking hey youlook at that prize purse you also ohMah let's go little double handdrag we we'll take a look at that fromthe front from mahina but there's thattrademark mahina may had a smileyou know you look at that uh that prizepurse we can't forget about the the taxman I think it's something like30% yeah whichum there is uh something where you canuh donate tax money to get uh taxcredits to nonprofits 51c3s um you're going to have the IRS atyour door as soon as this heat is overthey sir can we talk to you what are youtalking about AaronBrooks waiting for this thing to throwyeah oh she she did all the right thingsand then the wave was like no waveselection that's all that was that'sjust that's the youth it's going to getbetter and better the more she's outthere and killer style killerdropSierra again doing they're they're kindof into the pumps they're into thebackside J in my mind I see Jam Brian asthe the pump backside pump[Music]mastersimilar is that similar technique towhat we saw Molly Pamexecuting again Sierra K is 16 years ofage and an incredible she's lived a lotin those 16 years uh stab HighChampion um incredible air that she didat Lakey Peak that was kind of H aroundthe world at stephigh just won the ISA World Juniorsshe's working on her own uh feature filmthat she's been shooting all over theworld we heard Josh Kerr in an interviewyesterday um he was asked you know whenwhen'suh when's Sierra getting on tour when'sSierra getting on tour and he's likewe're not in any rush you know that'sthe demands and how the how aboutthe the advantage that she has in beingable to have that experience in herhousehold yeah from the years that thatJosh did on tour to be like there'sthere's literally no rush because of itrequires a lot he I believe he said hehe said specifically we're going to letSierra become a woman and then make thatdecision when she wants to that's coolto to be able to have that Outlook as aparentum we know you're out there listeningdad and mom who want your child to be ontour at age eight I mean you go to anyNSSA event uh on a on a on a weekend uhthe energy of of you know enthusiasticand passionate parents but sometimes theway they're driving these kids thesedays scos you're just like this they'rejust kids call up kais get on hisband can be a scream in the band of thespur grooves yeah it's not that seriousyet let them bekids yeah it'suh living vicariously through yeah whichI'm doing uh through these women rightnow I'm some of these waves and I wouldbe even if I got that last wave themahina got this morning I'd be stokedknow perfect of a day it is it's funnywe we we saw the the similar techniquebetween Molly pum and here Ur they'vebeen spending time together stand byAaron Brooks oh comeon oh who that would have beensomething looking looking at that anddoingthat yeahwhoa again another16yold originally from bornTexas I mean and she's just beentraveling around the world surfingnothing but heavy waves since she wasprobably six or seven look at this thinghumped I think they're going to they'rethey're probably going toreally be a major threat and you knowwhen it comes to like these sort ofbarrels I mean look at Moana likemoana's some of the waves that Moanagets out at pipeline it's not like ohthat's good for a girl or it's good fora woman the waves that Moana is gettingout at pipe are some of the best yeah Imean look at the tutelage that Aon hasbeen under you know she's worked withMiles padaka you know Shane bash andShane Dorian U kaha Hart from a veryyoung age I mean she's taken the littlebits from all of those Legends and she'salready uh able to apply it look atthat don't look at the replay on thatone that thing just blewlife into theworldohcareful when you fall in that outsiderail at a place like this that's whenyou just you just want to make sure yousee uh the athlete come back up outsiderail that is one of the themost the worst situations to happen ohAaron back at it wow good job ohyes that was[Music]sick yeah good job that was a good oneImean gets packed in the close outpaddles right back out and just boomthis is

feeling winds look likethey're shifting and look at thisscratching into it drop kind of holdingherlinewow with aspit again having that confidence to youknow hold that line and when the wave isis behind you on a back on the back sideyou're you know she's looking forwardshe's not trying to look up around she'strying to find her line and that takes abit of a fair bit of confidence to thinkokay this thing is going to Barrel Ijust got totrust and pick that line confidence isnot something that Sierra Kerr lackslet's look at it from theback fulldisappearance blown outwe love it we love to see it I Idon't you know just Within These firsttwoHeats there's not I don't really feelthere'slike the the distinguish between men'sand women's there's it's just it'sdisappearing literally as we're

the surf just keeps improving theswell is building what an exciting dayoh yeah beautiful it's um you knowearlier this morning I know people wereworried aboutuh they're worried about the Wes beingsmall and who serves first and I thinkthat uh perfect call being made womengetting put into some nice beautifulconditions here at Pipeline and K it isso much easier to call these seats whenthere's something to talk about that'sright yeah we were we were struggling onthat other day oh my gosh it was likepulling teeth with long LS trying tofill the space just make up whatever youcan to keep the heat not boring today itwill not be a factor it's going tobeepic and pumping right now a littlelow in the action that last Heat waswave after wave after wave and you knowI heard a girl come in and be like ohman you know it just wasn't enoughthere's no excuses today they're outthere you can put yourself into that topfour if you really want it it's therefor you to getit so with 24 minutes left in this heatMoana Jones Wong is looking to get oneof those scores on your screen you seethey're up into the 20o range thesegirls are getting up to 29 Pointsalready this morning so K the sky ispretty much the limit all of thosescores should be changed in should youwant to get into one of those covetedtop fourspots that'sright so glassy this morning justpicture perfect conditions here atpipeline that's been pretty goodconditions this whole entire event withlots of wind on the horizon our contestdirector Nathan Fletcher no stranger toPipeline and to knowing what good wavesare and to making sure all the Surfersget a chance to hit all the curriculumhere we have up and riding Sophie Bellon just a quickone today those quick ones aredefinitely not the call you could getyourself really hurt I seen some girlstaking off and jumping off right at thepeak yeah and it's almost like if you'regoing to come in you might as well ridethe wave out and paddle around it's amuch easier to get back out from theinside but talking about get back outthis girl got in she got out she got oneof the biggest scores of the day theever beautiful Sierra Kerr downstairswith Holly Sierra you've moved up intofourth place that in that last Heat wegot Moana Jones and the rest of thefield to go three more Heats remaininghow you feeling reck it's going to beenough oh I was really trying to get onemore but I couldn't make another so Idon't know I'm just hoping but glad youhave gotten one at least sick and uh wesaw your dad up there giving you somepointers positioning wise how much doeshe help you get those waves oh yeah hehelps a lot because you can't reallyright now especially because the sun'sum where I normally put my lineup on themountains so you can kind of see hisboard a little bit and you know that umthere's a set coming so that's good anduh you got a 29 out there really sickhigh score uh we got another bag ofcash looking let's check out this othat's all hehas Si all right enjoy the rest of yourday me she deserve thank you so muchHolly this young woman's future is sobright above the lip and behind thecurtain there on your screen you see16-year-old SRA Kerr just absolutelydominating the surf world and that isAaron Brooks's counterpart right therethat will be her competition and he andMaka all the women in this heat righthere need two new waves to make the topfour so they got their work cut out forthem this is the heat that counts yeahdefinitely and you see on screen dad anddaughter right there Josh CER one of thebest Surfers in his own right in his daylike they said he's surfing better thanever and uh to get that coaching is justthat is priceless right there to have afather that kind of a relationship withhis daughter competing right there butlike you said kiala in this heat Surfersneed at least two excellent scores eachto start to get into an advancingposition and right now Moana JonesWong is she's got to be tripping she'sshe's sitting in her lineup there's nowaves she just seen the lineupabsolutely light up in fire the lastHeat and now she's sitting there with nowaves 20 minutes to go but isn't thatkind of how it goes like I feel like oneone or two Heats will just be NonstopAction and speaking of action there wasMoana right there tucking into thebarrel oo big grab ra I don't know whatshe needs but I'll tell you what thatwave was not close to the other onesthat the girls caught with those bigscores I really think that maybe alittle strategy to better one of hermaybe her third wave and uh get outthere with 20 minutes left still has alot of time to catch those two excellentscores but that right there could be youknow a strategy she could you knowbetter one of her lowscores move up help her up just a littlebit you know so so the ask is not somuchI mean look at this beautifulpositioning tucking in I mean she rodethat wave as good as you can ride itjust uh I could tell by the size of herboard she's looking for something muchmore substantial but nonetheless abeautiful Barrel righthere by your reigning pipelineQueen Moana JonesWong what can you say about this girl'srise KKman um funny story about Moana so Iguess when we were I guess when she waslike 14 or something she surfed in herfirst pipe contest it was like one ofthose one stars that Betty deolo puts onand apparently like I might have likeyelled at her to get out of my way orsomething like that and she held on tothat Grudge for years and years andyears and we actually got into itspeaking of getting into it ohbig wipe out right there was that SophieBell yeah those are some of the thingsyou definitely want to stay away from uhcatching the waves and just jumping overthe falls just because I could see ifthere's scoring potential on that wavebut um you know that that wasa that was an elevator drop I mean thatwascharging and the some sets right here onthe horizon who do we have Moana JonesWong looking at this one and that's whatI'm talking look where Sophie Bell isnow that's that is a bad spot inabsolute apex of the wave and uh that'swhat happens when you jump over thefalls or kick out in the big of the thiswipeout just freef falling from the top ohthat wave was actually not bad she justgot hung up in the lip there yeah kickthe board out one thing about thesewaves out here at Pipeline and back dooryou want to be underneath it as you cansee here she's kind of on top of theledge you see how how there's kind ofthe Waves doubling up underneath her andshe has to kind of go over that ledgeright there these kind of waves you wantto be down the face pulling in ohingabout pullingin yeah just like I said there shecomes that's the Moana we know we needto see that from beginning to end butI'll tell you what thisgirl this young woman right here is justwhat it's all about to serve pipelineshe is so happy there's Bab lefts andhere's the replay I mean look at thatjust charging by theboil beautiful takeoff textbook dropback door in the section blown out she'shappy she is stoked that is going to puther right back in the she needs to getinto this top 10 uh this top four rightnow know being you know all the thingswe said all the things she'saccomplished I mean she's really got achip on her shoulder I think watchingthose other girls get those good wavesat at her spot that was beautifulI mean nobody likes to give up the strapand she's uh fighting back for it rightnow one more wave like that and I canalmost guarantee you that Moana JonesWong will be in that top fourspots Ian look at that looking exactlywhere she needs to be perect lineperfect stance getting low touching thewall with her hand knowing where she'sat look at thatspit guess what how good how good doesthat feel when you get blown out of abig barrel at pipeline oh feels muchbetter than when you don't get blownout welcome to the booth hello you guysare lot lot of action you guys know himas the wizard behind John JohnFlorence's Madness Mr John fil hi guyswhat's up thanks for joining us thismorning yeah that was sick so fun fact20% of the competitors in this event areriding your boards oh that's epic yeahyeah sick I love it wow it's goodhopefully they're doing doing good aslong if they're going to do good it'lltranslate into sales and we'll be offwith thesunset well you know that being saidthere's a reason a lot of these peopleare riding pisel boards out here I meansome of the best pipe Surfers to everlive um especially in this generationright pel I mean if you don't know theman you must be hiding under a rockbecause his boards have won some of thegreatest events ever it's ridden by oneof the best Surfers on planet Earth andum you're just kind of pushing thelimits and and experimenting and makingnew things for these Surfers that surfpipe all the time and can you talk aboutmaybe a little bit about the equipmentEvolution out here that you've been seeyeah like what does it take to make theperfect magical pipeline board I wish Iknew I'm trying I'm still trying tofigure it out um I think the uh the coolthing here about living here obviouslyis that I just get to work like justnaturally with all these like kidscoming up like they're all young kids inthe beginning or whatever and then thekids that I've been working with likeincluding your brother have Co um havejust become they're like the guys atpipeline which is pretty cool for me andum they're just all it it's funny likearound the world you they're they'reseen as like these pipe Superstars orwhatever but they're just like the kidsfrom down the street or whatever youknow Co lives 50 feet from my house Johnlives down the road Ian you know Nathantoo and um so it's just been fun workingwith those guys and like actually justgetting to watch what they do and thenusing their feedback to try to improveevery you know what is what is harder tomake the perfect pipe board or to shapea board say for a wave like trestles umI think both of those have a really bigchallenge it's a matter of like justkind of uh looking at what the wave isgoing to do and what kind of poweryou're working with and all that stuffso those are such different boards andif you try to ride one for pipe attrussels obvious look at this up againwow just got to get a better one thanthat yeah that was sick but kind ofsmall yeah um what was her last score Iwouldn't know what her she's in 64 no soshe's in fourth she got a 28 she's infourth already so she's up in the fourthspot with one wave all right so28.9 that's sick um yeah anyways they'reboth they're both uh real challengingand for me it's important like uh livinghere in Hawaii it's really importantthat like I travel a lot to shape andlook around and just pay attention towhat's going on with different boards indifferent places and try not to be toolike centered on boards that are justfor Hawaii and that's just the importantpart for me is like learning as I'mtraveling and listening to people and myfeedback from my team and step will helpme make boards for crappy waves too notthat trestles is crappy but while we'vebeen speaking with John it's okay Moanagot an 18.2 and a 29 28.9 in less than 5minutes moving up into the fourth spotyes I mean look right here this must bethe uh 18.2 I mean not that deep on thatone kind of more of a pocket ride but uhthe way before that beautiful stallingmaneuver and uh now you see Sierra Kerris out of the top four officially shewill not be competing in our finalsMoana Jones has taken that fourth spotand she is looking to move up aswell it must be a big thing uh pisel touh get the right Surfer with the rightboard under their feet because allSurfers tend to Surf a lot differentlydifferent styles on waves for sure sohow do you kind of tailor make do youmake one model that kind of fits all oris there certain tweaks that certainSurfers like to make wa that was a latejob lip in the head rightthere um I think that uh what I kind ofstart with the basics that work good formost people and then Terry like tunethose boards for each guy basically orgirl either way and um just try to makesure that like if there're those guysare giving me feedback so like I haveguys some guys that ride a little widernoses or a little more you know justdifferent rockers or different thingsbut like all of that basically comesfrom like a basic starting point thatboards that I know have worked good atpipeline for a long time and then youjust work off that and tailor it to thethe the surfer you know nice and hereyou go as you talking boards we seeboards coming to the beach right nowSophie Bell looks like uh she got herBell rung a little bit right there onthatone and uh you know just you got to becareful out here it's you know pipelineis not really for everyone and thesegirls are definitely charging but uhsome of those waves you got to becareful where you jump off and how youjump off I mean you seen Chum's brotherum joal chanka jump off on a wave afour-footer in the wrong spot and youknow that guy is no stranger to bigbarrels but uh you got a good point islike not only are people learningpipeline but they're also having tolearn how to jump how to survive a wiout of pipeline like a lot of peoplehaven't had that experience you knowthat's something we don't really thinkabout that much like okayit will that experience how do you getout of that position in good shape issomething you got to learn too it'salmost like if you charge absolutelyyour hardest you don't get as in troubleas if you go like halfway out any littlehesit full speed half tank Full Throttleis better than you know full tankthrottle half throttle you know what Imean nobody really likes that I seen a Iseen Eevee Wong on screen earlieryawning and I'm like you better wake upnow girl it's fly no time to sleep notime to sleep now we got uh 10 minutesshe's got some time to get back outthere and get a wave um she's definitelycharging replay there it is right herebeautiful Drop kind of late and thenside slipped which messed up her lineright there the wave the wave kind ofwent out to sea as well it's kind of awhat we call a clamper you see it kindof shut down on the end right there alittle and got high it's uh somethingyou got to watch out for is the angle ofthe wave when it comes in it might looklike this nice Tepe but if it's comingacross the reef too much it'll have thislike chandelier clamshell at the endinstead of one that has maybe a littletail on it that you know it's going tocome at you and as it comes at you it'sgoing to you know make the wave throwand open up more some of those ones thatare very hard to take off on there's areason you take off behind the barreland pull into the barrel instead ofdropping right on the peak becausesometimes they think oh I'm going todrop in on the peak but that's thehardest place to drop in the worst placeto be really is at the peak yeah it'skind of funny and that's changed a lotthough I think over the years where likeback back in like the old days not theold old days but where like people aregetting in early so they weren't likethey weren't taking off under the lipbut they're getting in early and thatwas a little different thing where youdid want to kind of be at the peak butnow it's like people are getting in latebehind it and that's where you're goingto get a good Barrel Malia kin Maka upand riding on a little right just up anddown but yeah I even changed some of myequipment to start looking more likethat old Derek Hull Jerry Style BS thatare thicker because those guys weregetting just as barreled if not morebarreled than the guys today and they'recoming from the outside big bottom turnsand Fading Into ho waves at the pipeMasters back in the day and like I meanjust those boards they would ride lookslike they're getting so much easier yeahand it's almost like everybody wanted togo smaller and more eag out and likemore upside down and sideways to whereyou know I was watching uh Ivan's heatthe other day that or the Florence heatand uh that that one left Ian took offlike under like I saw a photo of itlater and he was like it was alreadylike this and he's paddling standing upyou know I'm just like to even likethink that like oh I'm just going to goon this one you know I know he was justlike amped up or whatever but it wasjust like such a crazy position to be inspeaking of the Florence Brothers we gotanother heat coming up with all theFlorence Brothers in it again tell uslike what's what's their Dynamic arethey competitive and uh knowing eachother so well do they start usingtactics to uh get in each other's headbefore we let John answer that questionwe are going to take a break here at theVans pipe Masters2023 right here on the beautifulNorthshore of Oahu Havi thank you allfor joining us today we'll leave you atLura and of on thescreen my biggest fear about surfingpipe is my fear is more like notsucceeding like of course I'm scared ofthe wave and like scared of hitting thebottom but I never want my fears or mydoubts to hold me back from doingsomething that I think I can do I tendto be harder on myself so I just don'tlike think of this I'm more like okaywhat what do I want to do and how am Igoing to get there hitting the insectionat pipe makes me feel if it gives youthe opportunity go for it like Mason hoLanding an air on like a 7ft board atthe end section of like after gettingsuper Barrel is just so excitingwelcome back to one of the mostbeautiful views in the world one thatnever gets old the Drone shot from thevan pipe houses over to the lineup atPipeline on the fabled NorthShore ofOahu in Hawaii we are in round threeheat three and we got about 7 minutesleft um Moana is going to need a 19.4 tomove into the thir third play Spot justto protect that lead cuz the fourth playSpot keeps on changing yeah yeah everyheat it's changing so she's going towant to get another high score just tosecure her spot in the finals you don'twant to be sitting on that fourth spotwith more heat more heat coming up youcrossing your fingers you know if ifyou're in heat five and you're in thefourth spot and uh there's no one afteryou it's fine that's fine but this isheat three there's two more Heats ofvery very capable women coming up nowMoana Jones Wong really wants in sixminutes to be able to get one more scoreto add to her score line I me you seeright behind her there's Bella KenworthyI mean there's so many girls ready to gono Sierra just got out she's done ohwhat about Gabriel uh Gabriel branGabriel Brian she's still going she hasanother heat oh yes she does yeahinteresting that's second change fastthat's got to be stressful finishingyour heat and watching it's so differentthis format where you're seeing likeyou're not you're not losing but you'relike you can get knocked back out evenafter you've made it into that positionthink I think it's awesome because everyevent snowboarding all the other actionsports are kind of like that it's notreally a single elimination me versusyou it's like you get to keep comingback and watch your favorite Surfer surfuntil the finals right it's like it'salmost like sometimes you get rid ofhalf your viewership when you when yousend your Surfer gets knocked out andall of a sudden there's a heat thatdoesn't have waves oh he's not the bestanymore why cuz the waves just suck forthat 20 minutes you know what I mean sothis is the kind of a format thateverybody gets to perform perform andlike Nathan said perform in alldifferent conditions and see all thefaces of Pipeline and you're no strangerto pipeline I mean you surf out here anduh your boards it's been a while justhappen to be uh under the feet of someof the greatest pipeline Surfers I meanyou got the Florence boys you got mybrother Kaa is the bread sck a realmodelI hope I hope CO's watchingthis finally broke him quick recap ofthis heat there was a one of moana'sbiggerscores that was her18 got such great style yeah she's sicklook at this thing oh oh that was Sophiebill just charging again ringing thebell Dam that looks a lot like jal's huhthat's what I said that's it's jumped inthe same spot this is here Moana again abomb beautiful wave who's that MoanaLopez Jones Wongyeah perfect position coming in from thecold look at this girl look at that spitshe was somehow she always matches herred jersey with her little red helmetynice Al there's backup score right heredragging across dragging the arm nicepositioning and here's the bell ringerrighthere oh she got almost like jumped intothe lip you know like at the the movieNorthshore when it says when the wavebreaks here don't be there that's kindof one moment one of those she put rightthere when the wave breaks here don'tdon't be there yeah don't intentionallyput yourself there cuz that's what's youyou're going to uh what is it you'regoing to hit thereef no yeah the wave breakes here don'tbe there or you're going to get drilledare you going to get drilled or you'regoing to get drilled that's the line Cyou're so hly you don't even know you'rehly such a c classic I was in that movieyou were you I'm Chandler's son yeah noway oh yes that's epic when they throwthe sticks go get it Rex walking outlittle kid I remember uh Al oh Zoe ohzoeee going for a snap that looks like apisel right there yes it does uh she'snot getting the wave she wants that'sfor sure oh these waves have barely beencoming Moana Jones have been on thepretty much the only real scorable wavesyou know she's kind of sat there tookher spot she she's got the hours inthere more than anyone else in this heatfor sure yeah almost look like zoy washunting some rights there were somerights that came in earlier anduh and what do you think you thinkanybody's going to disrupt this top fourright here I think we got who' you seeGabby Bryan is coming in I think ifthere was more rights I would think thatshe has a great chance um I haven'treally seen her backside tube ridingthat much but um I don't know this is apretty solid like grouping right therelike those would have to be thefavorites we Frankie Herrera we gotFrankie Herrera out there with some somesmooth ones she's coming up in the nextHeat she's got a real good chance cuzshe's got a high score already was whatshe got two 17s in her first heat Ididn't see her second heat did she havea higher score than that I'm not surebut it looks like uh the waves aresuited perfectly for her surfing espe weseen lately yeah she's sick that a latedrop into the Barrel in uh yeah day oneyeah that was nice that was one of thenicer ways it's cool to see mom thereshe's a mom and she's getting waves outthere so she needs she needs one of them29 Point almost a perfect wave to crackthe top four or better her two waves soshe can either replace her two you knowlower scores or get one high score of a29.7 which is definitely doable todaythere's tens out there that's possiblethat that's going to be a tall orderthough cuz I think the highest scorewas what was that a couple Heats ago wasa 29.5 is that Molly I think it wasMolly get for that one backside Barrel29 I think it was a 29 sick she was kindof like had that little look up likepump it was a 29.4 I stand correctedexcuse me we were wrong by one tenth ofa point excuse us we make mistakes we'rehuman we like to keep it accurate aspossible here we like to keep itcontroversial here on at the at the vanpipe Masters 202 thank you so much piselfor coming in and calling this heat withus we have a minute left not much actionto go those of you who don't know

waves and she has a highscore she got two high ones the otherday let's see what she can do in thisnext Heat there's your current top 10your current top four finalist and thatwill change should these girls get outthere and grab the bull by the horns andride that 8C memorable ride and there'ssome Bulls out there we're going to seea stampede by the end of the day as thisswell fills inmore round three heat 4 Laura AnderNorth Nar New South Wells Australia Cocoright here Sunset Beach is own of aahuhavai Frankie herrer out of MalibuCalifornia and eeveLea out of aahu kushuHawaii did that really say kushu Hawaiiwhere's that that's sound in like Japanlike a oh maybe it's Japan by the way ofJapan I I've never heard of that townbefore yeah I was like I've been livinghere a longtime kushu for all of her fans back athome inJapanuh yeah Frank go go oh is that a watercam right here somebody's wearing awater cam oh they're sell they'reselling Frankie on this first one goFrankgo you guys just heard the perfectexample on what it sounds like to sellyour competitor a junk wave right offthe bat and that's how it goes go yeahtake this one yeah one they're lookingback likeha we've all done it it we've all doneitoh Kelly Slater's the master sing guyson waves likethat it'suh it is really awesome to have someonemiked up not too many times you get tohear the sales pitch in acontest sales pitch though I wonder ifthat was like it must have been likecoko or Lura sending her on that one forsure she bought it thoughdoesn't look like it's going to affecther too much though cuz she's right outthe back and in position already thatwas actually good to to get thebutterflies and the bugs out right offthe bat with nothing else coming get outthere shank it out a bitand I knew it we have Laura ener withthe mic saleswoman of the[Laughter]Year oh that would be cool to see howmany of those you could put together ohlike a little Montage like go go broyeah this one you're on this one andthen show the actual waves that thepeople catch and people send them onwaves that'll be alltime well here we go talking aboutselling it or sending it Laura on theleft lookingPinchy andCoco coming out oh come on sister thatwould have been a hugescore a missed opportunity there for Mrskokoo who's really good on selling metrash waves was Andy and Bruce when wewere growing up they were always doingthe Hard Sell on the worst wave yeah cuzthey were never giving away the good oneso for sure anyone they told you to goon was going to be a junk one oh yeahand then they and they loveed seeing youwipe out they loved watching me wipe outfor their for their entertainment wasthat one and if I didn't go on the wavesthey would say you know they would giveme a hard time like ah you w out so Ireally had no choice yep once upon atime so that's what big brothers do toyou no it's Brotherly Love they make youtough they made me tough for sure on thelast exchange these girls should not betaking on off on these waves well on theleft this right and still it's Pinchyright now there's waves that can takeyou to the next level and those wavesthat size of wave today is just notgoing to do it like even if you getbarreled on that wave cool but you gotto get a score in the 20s now to I meanif you want if you're comparing yourselfto what's been going on the score scoresWise It's like watching Shawn White doget a 90o run and then you think oh I'lljust do a you know 70 point round bu allright you're not winning like that yougot to go and wait this contest is thiscontest is the perfect format so thatyou can relax get out there and choosethe one because right now in your thirdround it really doesn't matter if youget a bunch of 17s and 18s no they'renot that's not going to be in your topif it's not a eighto score looking waveor above there's absolutely no reasonyou should be catching it unless youwant to just sit around and watch thefinals and have at all these little onesand you will be cheering from thesidelines right yeah they're going toneed some scores in the 20 point rangeI'm thinking 25 25 and up 25 27 and upright now especially with the scoresthat we havenow I meane Wong definitely needs uh two morescores you know 22 is right there buteverybody you know the top girls havewhat they have 22 27 23 24 22 29 20 2125 17 18 28 like if you don't have uh 28or higher 275 or higher in your scoreline somewhere you're probably not goingto advance and right there we see Ithink the only Surfer that can get onescore andstilladvance and right here on your screen wehave the queenherself Moana Jones Wong on on the beachwith h Moana well done for starters uhI've asked this question to the last twoHeats in a row you've moved up intofourth place on the leader board do youthink it's going to be enough to getinto the final I don't know like sarrawas just in fourth and then I justknocked out of fourth and I'm in fourthI wanted to be like rather in like thirdthen I'd feel more safe but I don'treally feel super safe right now so Ihope I may it to the finals I hope I canhold on to this fourth spot yeah me tooI'm K to watch and uh how different doesThis Thing feel to other comps you'vedone here it's different because it'slike I think it's harder actuallybecause it's like you can improve andkeep improving and everybody keepsimproving so it just gets harder andharder all right beautiful thank youwelldone well there you have it thank youHolly thank youMo and uh check out this replay this isthe wave that got her in that for a spotthat's an absolute jiner she knew itwhen she came out hands high that wasenough and uh right now we have thesegirls just absolutely chomping at thebit right behind her and eeve Wong coulddo it with a pair of 20s I thinksomething like that could maybe uh gether up into that uh coveted Fort spotwell she's holding on to a pair of sixesand she's going to definitely want toreplace those low scores well you needyou need64.5 to get in so she she's got to gettwo she's got 23 she's got to get two21s to getthere um and that is 21 across the boardmeaning seveno ride by each judgeadd it up totally possible which istotally possible if there's waves I'mnot sure if I tripped on the court orone of these girls forgot to put moneyin the machine before they went out butit is totallyflat well what's the forecast 0 toeight we still got 20 minutes leftthough so they gottime they got time we as competitorsknow how fast 20 minutes can go by in aheat or how slow it is when uh you knowyou're leading and uh somebody needs asmall score and that clock is tickingdown and you just want to click downtick down as fast as possible so you canmake it through the Heat and you'rewatching the other person praying to Godthey don't get thatscore at that time in those times I feellike the the clock is painfullyslow yeah you're right right when uhit's you who's up against theropes trying to get teed off on you justhope the bell rings and and here we gooh like I said hair it's that wave justshut down ah she didn't make it off thebottom anyway she just barely made itinto the barrel late drop beautiful shetraveled for a second there but she wastoo far to the bottom of the wave and OhWhat a Beautiful attempt by Frankienonetheless I'm and she was right theredropped in just barely got under thelip and all that turbulence there didn'thave the speed to keep up to finish offthatride but she's right there K I meanshe's knocking on the door yeahdefinitely see everybody sitting out theback just waiting forthat big beautifulBarrel oh oh yeah you know Lauraaniverse going to give it a goal she'sgot to replace all threescor Laura's got to replace all threescores Laura's got to get busyyeah when you're in that position that'snot the time to just wait around youhave to start building sixes is goodsixes sevens and you get a 10 or a nineyou got to just kind of build thatup anduh right now if I was Lura I'd bethinking like am I going to have enoughtime to get three big scores you knowwith the lws she's got to she's got tostrategize really good here to make sureshe's got enough time to get three goodwaves she needs three strategy oneshould be catch the best wave you can asquick as possible is isn't that always astrategy though strategy too catch thenext best wave as quick as possiblestrategy three rinse and rinse andrepeat rinse and repeatwell well now that we have a l in theaction we will be right back thank youfor sticking around with us on finalsday here at Vans pipe Masters2023 Mahalo newo and I'll see you soon Ilive right like one song away from pipeor like a half a song by the time you'repulling up to pipe or like you'repassing Sunset it's almost you hear likethe guitar like barely tickling inyou're like who am I psyching am I waand then you start getting and by thetime you're at pipe it's just like likejust starting the Wailing and then youcould just pull up and sit in your carfor a minute like oh I'mpsyching I hope someone sees me oheveryone's there everyone sees me what'sup time remember Uncle drick he us toblast his jams too so I just take mytime aminute once again welcome back for thoseof you who just joined us we are here onfinals day it looks like we had a riderduring the break it looks like FrankieHerrera hucked herself on another wavethere on your screen you can see allthat white water you can tell that a sethas come through and look at the textureon the water I tell you right in Alkiala when that trade win kicks in withthis size lurchy swell we are going tosee some amazing acrobatics tumblingdown thesewaves we've already seen a few that thiswind just makes it that much more fun towatch I know a stiff offshore likereally holds the barrels up makes themreally Hollow but I find sometimes thatthat wind coming up the face can justhold hang you up at the top a littlemore yeah which can cause some prettydramatic wipeouts you just got to dig that muchharder and sometimes you know the sprayis like blowing in your face you'retaking offblind oh yeah and uh looks like we mighthave some waves moving the wind islooking perfect right now I mean look atthat shape of that wave now all we needis somesets the girls getting into position Imean look at how beautiful that water isjust spittingbarrels if you want it you can get ittoday at the van pipe Masters the swellis on the rise good call by contestdirector Nathan fler two more Heats ofwomen or one more heat of women and awomen's final so after this next Heatnot this heat the next one there will bea twom man a two Heats of men and then afinals Frankie Herrera again that willnot be the one oh that's a beautifulBarrel nonetheless[Music]yes but uh just missing that beginningpart of that waveum beautifully surfed beautiful wave Ijust think that to get into that top twoshe's going to need a wave you drop infrom behind the peak pull in the barrellike she did the other day so Archcoming through and I really think rightnow the big scores and the reason I saidthat's not the one is because the bigscores are going to be coming from thatoutside section pulling in off the dropyou know she came around it nicelyperfect positioning got a little Barrelbut you see on your screen29.7 is what she needs to advance youeither cut that in half or you get thatone timemhm so uh whatever she's got has to beatwhatever scores are on her score linerightnow and it looks like she's got a lowscore of a seven she definitely is goingto want to replace and then she'sholding on to 217so let's look at the replace no matterwhat it's going to replace that seveny little inside Barrel you see on thatoutside if she could have got her railin the water right here is kind ofbouncy see how she kind of projects outshe would have got the tuck into thatfirst part and then come through thatBarrel that would have been very highscore yes right have knifed it rightinto the barrel instead of dropping downto the bottom of those are one of thoseyou have to hug the wall they call itwhen you stand up and you put one or twoof your arms in and you stall yourselflet the wave throw over you and then youstart pumping through those sectionsthere's a couple different ways you cansurf those waves you know come out drawa line out to the bottom like she didbottom turn sneak into the pit or youcan try and hold yourself as long aspossible up at the top while it throwsover and then start pumping throughthose sections right yeah that would beideal Franky herrerEevee Wong kokoo and Lauraener all looking to try and get a spotin the top four of

been a a history makinground three at the Vans pipe Mastersgood Dr CliffKono it's it's all happening before uswe're watching some crazy charging rightnow hope e is all right after takingthat nasty spillFrankie definitely charging to Laura aswell they're Koko got how's that n onethat Coco just got yeah Imean pushing themselves over the ledgethe one that KOCO went on back door andlook at this groom Pizza magic an heobviously want some piece ofthis startnow the wind is grooming the land isheating up trades are filling ingrooming the surface of thewave yeah it's this swell is filling inquickly what are our expectations uhfrom the forecast for those who are justjoining us we're seeing that the anincomingfreshly Northwest well is coming in longperiod eWong wow trying to take a big droptrying to stick it oh a very bad placeto fall looking at back door trying tojust stick the airdrop sliding offlanding something happened maybe hit herface she's now some blood looks like shehit her headoh you see her being attended toyeah I think she might haveum hit obviously hit the reef I mean howshallow is it when you when you'refalling on a 68ft wave there oh it'sshallow it's it's just less than four 4feet 4T deep less uh shallower than howtall she is for sure and that thatconsistency of reef is just like it'slike landing on concrete oh yeah it'sbut again there's there's not a lot oflive reef there but those little piecesof live reef that are there they'rereally Jagged and sharp so you could bein that unlucky situation of justhitting that tiny little coral reef orthat coral paa Coral Colony there at theback door and that could easily justwith the power of moving across it'slike you know a paper cut you cutyourself imagine a liveCoral well we will uh hope that she uhis able torecover see her being tended to by ourmedical staff in thisheat I mean just a bunch of incredibleSurfers BethanyHamilton who is just an allaroundcharger remember at cloudbreak back in2016 uh she got a third place loves toscratch into big big waves towed intoJaws Etc uh speaking of of of chargingFrankie her just throwing herself off ofeverything olly yeah she was going forit wasn't she uh Frank how the wife'sout their building swall and stuff howjust tell us how it is yeah there is thechance of a couple incredible waves so Ijust kept going on them and there was alittle couple that stretched out and Iwas just like I don't know had to giveit a fewgoes uh well you had an incredibleperformance and really nice to see yougoing for it in that heat love watchingit Frank and uh shame that he didn'tmake the top four but are you howdisappointed are you I guess I woulddefinitely like to be in the final buthopefully I get another little invitenext year and can try again I'm happy tojust have got gotten barreled a coupletimes and yeah thanks for theopportunity beautiful yeah yeah I'm sureyou'll be invitedback cheers Frank without a shadow of adoubt Frankie will get that invite backum just unafraid to charge she talkedabout it with in in our interview youknow she's a new mom um and she eversince she's had her daughter she findsherself wanting to charge even harder uhand maximize herperformancescan we talk about how Anthony wal Walshwasstanding side conversation what wasgoing on over there pipeline not nostranger to pipeline all right nowlisten this is the fifth and Final Roundopportunities to change the game andmake it into the final you see Annie andBethany in that 16 and 17 spot but foryoung Bella Kenworthy and GabrielGabrielle O'Brien a little bit less workto do for them in the ninth and seventhspot you know what a great story BellaKenworthy is at just 16 years of age youknow she had sort of a a fear mindsetthat she had to get over when it comesto pipeline when she first got theinvitation she kind of left the messageon red like she was like o I don't knowher team manager actually had to respondfor her um since she's gotten here she'sbeen in the water non-stop she said shestarted to get some waves last year thatmade her feel a little bit morecomfortable but again pipe it this is awave it's different from any other wavein the world and making the choice thatI okay I'm going to actually buildrelationship with it means that you'regoing to go through some things yeahtotally this isn't an easy dance so tospeak out here at pipeline Bethany laydropwell look like she was able to get outof the way of her board and she camedown also under wow that was kind of ashe's under for a moment with theGoPro see that again Bethany reallytrying to give it a dig standing up laydropwall almost kicked the board away alittle bit when she knew she wasn'tgoing to makeit yeah Bethany having a a go at itstill here at the Vans Pipeline Masterswe've watched her grow up from such ayoung age so many accolades now motherof four as we see Annie do Santos Anniewhoa big drop kind of quite engaged atra originally from Rio De JaneiroBrazil lives in Sunrise Sunrise BeachAustralianow she was an alternate she had an Alalternate spot for last year was wasunable to get in so she's psychedto be able to have this opportunitywe're joining us now special guest herein the booth the one and only noDean Noah welcome to the booth Che is inthe hall stoked to here how fired upwere you when you saw what wasdeveloping this morning pretty fired upand then I had a coffee and then I gotnervous kind of stock standard alwayshappens I think once you paddle out youkind of get rid of that I don't knowwatching it from the beach um kind ofmakes you freak out every time how longdo you watch it before padding out areyou from what I seen a lot of times youkind of just get up grab your stuff andjust get out there yeah I mean I'mpretty sure I just sit around at thehouse all day watching it and probablyburned myself out but I think kind ofwatch it for a while and then just rightbefore you go out you kind of got tojust stop watching it for 20 minutes orelse you just I don't know you just sofocused on it and looking at how good itis you I don't know kind of it roast youyou know talk yourself in circles y forsure looks like you got some pretty goodwaves so far you saw your Northshorecampay off pretty good or was that likea back door off the- wall a couple ofthem right when you first came yeah hada couple um it was real crowded and justgot lucky getting a few straight up andthat's pretty much all all I want to dowhen I come over here is get a few wavesand I'm kind of already stoked out soanything that I get in the combo or notis abonus yeah it's it's interesting to seewhat what's everyone riding what's yourtake on it it seems like you have apretty your your boards don't seem toopinned out seems like they'remaneuverable you're you definitely nomatter how heavy it's getting you stillwant to get a bit of release on it isthere a a thought process to that yeah Ithink when I know that I might be goinguh right I'll probably try and ride alittle bit shorter board it's kind offunny because the I feel like I want toride a 68 for the left but then as soonas I get a right on a 68 unless you'vetaken off in the right spot you likecould be too big but when you're in aheat you get to take off in a bit betterspot so that kind of changes everythingyou can kind of ride exactly what youwant in the Heat and I think sometimesprobably in the free s i ride a littlebit too small a board but you kind ofgot to make that in between guess youknow seems like there's been a battlebetween Channel Islands andwhat was um what were the top boardsagain Channel Islands and pisel pel yeahand then there's some dhds in there JsJs but what what are you on coming outhere uh I ride LSD and from seemed to beworking yeah those first couple of dayswhen it was big in wobbly I was riding aquad too which is weird for me wow butum uh been riding quite a little bitlately really yeah how's that how's thatgoing if I find like when you get whenit gets Pinchy or tight you can kind ofjust ride straight through it and thenwhen you're too deep which is a lot ofthe time out here in a freeer I feellike you're always taking off in thewrong spot oh my God little splitPeak bany just getting who did tossedtwice did a to come out of the whitewater on that thing I don't know thatshould be some points just making thatdrop and getting thesafety have a look on the replay what isit uh Noah about where you'refrom that makes it so that you guyslike like manners and and Russell holdon let's have a lookhere whatoh she did well getting out in front ofthat thing that could have endedbadly that was a legit airdrop that feels nice when you get in abad spot like that and you can get outof theresafely I'msurejust Po and over yeah what is it aboutwhere you're from yeah I think um butyou and V like yeah what's going on downthere just the whole of Oz I thinkthere's a bit of a Melting Pot of peoplewho just love suring real cooked wavesand I know I mean Ross is insane andhe's kind of the leader of the parkreally and then obviously Sean and meand Harry and S St together and we alljust kindof I don't know share love for heaviersort of waves and and sponge gottenpushed yeah it seems like there're aheavy on the body a little bit too it'spretty funny but a lot of the waves thatyou surf down there are our waves thatwere were were sponge waves first yeahyeah for sure and now now we all kind ofjust Ser them together and that it's uma lot of people just are happy to surfwith each other down there so it'spretty sick good push in the water itdoes seem to be a bituh there's there's a few breaks that itseems they're allowed to share with theworld and then there's quite a ton ofwaves that it's for you folks we talkabout Pik Club yeah yeah there'sdefinitely some secretive stuff downthere for sure which is cool you got tohave that looked like Bethany Hamiltonmade a switch in equipment maybe a maybea longer board yeah I wonder with thatlonger interval again there they'removing so fast yeah it looks like youwant a bit of board out there I reckonso you can at least take off a bitfurther out and yeah yeah I took 14minutes and 3 seconds yesterday to watchRussell bur's new edit and it'sridiculous I was I was I was traumatizedoh yeah I think everyone that's watchedit so far has definitely being leftscratching their head after that rightit's insane do you surf a bunch of thosewavesyourself um a couple of them I thinkmost ly though he was surfing an irandin that thing and um I've surfed shipStones before but not anything like thatI was[Music]stupid the last wave of the last thelast wave of the edit if you haven'twatched it yet it's up on stab folkslike that last wave will just make yourethink your whole life ah I know Ithink there's about six of them in a rowat the end where I was just going whatis going on here this well dude let'snot forget about your film release lastyear sure Nas I mean that thing wasfilled with technical Barrel riding uhso much so that uh a good friend ThomasCampbell reached out and said check thisout oh sick and you know like a lot oftimes uh you wonder who's the audiencethat's watching and Thomas Kell that'sjust he's a snob he's not he's nottelling he's not telling you to watchjust anything so that's a deal it kindof is if you I don't know if you know t-monk but he definitely has a very um avery developed and uh specific aestheticand pallet for surfing that if if youget something from teimo to watch yousaid it's so much better thanme you you're watching it you knowbecause he doesn't watch things yeah andhe's deep in the Redwood Forest makingart and working on his films yeah hesounds cool so yeah it was it was coolto see that your your performance uhtransmitted across broad audiences sodon't don't not give yourself the creditthat I think you deserve in yourtechnicality I think you got to keepReinventing yourself on yourself to keepstoked on it instead of just doing thesame thing over and over againso no I I I admire you making umchoosing to make that kind of contentespecially as things are becoming moreand more disposable totally via you knowthe gram and the talk uh to be like nowe're going to make some stuff thatstill can get people's attention and canbetimeless here we are some from nzdwow how long was the process making thisso this is mash my new one I made itafter Noz and um basically it was a yearand it kind of came together prettyquickly which normally it takes a whileor re longer to make something that's 46minutes but um yeah we kind of got ittogether pretty quick and it was meantto just be a few leftover clips and thenwe ended up getting some SE waves for itso we go Bethy Bethy God it's so scarywhen that happens going over youroutside rail is the worst thing everyeah we've been talking about thatearlier worst thing to watch dude youwouldn't wish it on someone you'ddislike no you know I I almost wonderwhen in the ASM world if people want tostart making that outside rare a littlethicker or something so does want tolike catch like a safety training littlekickstand yeah I feel like oh what'sthis next ondoing it's pretty hard tolike oh that wassick nice jop it's hard to like surfpipe when the sw's coming up foreveryone cuz if you're not in the rightspot it's definitely a good chance ofgetting smoked or not getting bed yeahand um whowow let's go let's go let's go yes thatwas sick good job Annie do SantosI I mean like every wave you see thismorning most of them have pretty scarydrops yeah like it's definitely notperfect and the women have beenanswering the call all morning justcharging oh yeah it's actuallyinsane look at this thing wowdisconnected that was realsick I would have been stoked on thatyeah I think that's what we've beensaying all morning any of these waves wewould beshe did really good to just slow downjust enough too yeah cuz if you try getto deep then you unless you're behindthat bit there which is so hard to beyou're not going to make it out of theend bit before it closes out yeah it's afine line between getting real tubed andnot making it well it's also too with aan empty lineup on Pipeline that's likecan be a little bit rattling too to beif you're not surfing it if you don'thave a really close relationship with itagain not quite getting in there ifyou're out there by yourself you'relooking around you're like wait where ismy lineups I usually know someonethey're in the spot you play off ofpeople I think too when it's when theSWS just started it feels like it breaksall a lot closer in and further down theline than probably when it's more linedup it's probably breaking out furtherand kind of all over the reef but rightnow it seems like it's kind of just bigwall walls and you kind of got to takeoff on the end of it which makes it realhard because it's not a big peig whereyou can kind of back door it well that'swhat's I think interesting again I'm notthe I don't call the I don't callanything but you look at the contestyou're like okay the swell stillbuilding do we give the Women's Firstlater there there is no matter whatthere's still going to be a distinctionbetween men and women right now untilit's heat backto back men women menwomen men women they're still going tohave to be making calls and this goingto be a little bit ofbias right now in my mind a rising swelllong period conditions are groomed thisis thegnarlier yeah you probably be right insaying that like it might get biggerlater but if the SWR starts cleaning upand it kind of settles is coming inslower and hitting it it's probably morechill than what's going on right nowyeah especially for new lineups for alot of these women that have never seenempty lineups out pipe I mean I'm sureyou know what's it like in thesecontests when you're out here atpipeline when you I mean you w the Aroheat that's for sure every time I Idon't know every time I get in a compI'm I'm either like one the third heatbecause it somehow is always cooking orjust the end of the day oh my God yeahthings moving waves are moving so fastfeels like the more sun that gets on itthe better it gets out here yeah I don'tknow why but must do something with theWindgood to see Bella pop up thereyeah oh Bethany just getting underneaththat one look at that thing it'sdeceivingly beautiful when you look atit from above you're like oh that's fulldoable that looks doesn't look anywherenear as big even on the replays from inreal life you look at these things inreal life back it looks like two threefoot bigger when you're watching it inreal life than on the Replay forsure as wesee WilliamBillykeer about to paddle out first heat hewas riding a 68 whichwas for him is pretty big out here umbut again with that broken metatarso hejust wanted his body to doless might be on a 66 rightnowum so we're speaking of um stainlimber Billy doing a bunch of umexercises Noah oh yeah what's yourflexibility about I don't know cuz we'rewe'rehearing you're you're insanely flexibleyeah I guess so um I don't know I do alittle bit of yoga not too much thoughcouple times aweek that's a lot for some people yeahit's hard to concentrate but okay waitwait let's roll this back I thinkcuz when I hear yoga I think UncleJerry and you're telling me brother Noahyou're out here yeah Irishyoga justkidding line of the day line of the dayoh n n you got to I don't know you can'tyou can't just do nothing especiallywhen you get get a bit older especiallywhen you're chucking yourself in the allsorts of death slab pits like you guyssort of live for like at a certain pointyour body's like natural ability ain'tgoing to cut it yeah I think I think thething it does most to is like I shoulddo it way more but it feels like it kindof brings it in the present moment getsyou off your phone death scrolling youknow yeah so that's nice so are we goingto see a noad uh gym setup at the housefull weight rack a whole deal is thatcomingsoon another kind of rack Maybe[Laughter]are oh ohBethany couldn't quite find the yeahbetter than going over the falls againyeah I reckon you definitely get moreconfidence from not nose Ian yeah yeahcan get in your head pretty hard if youkeep putting the nose under on a couplewow and really late dropping I mean thisis the some of those ones were prettybad waves that kind of not tubing andbut you still got I mean you're in aheat you still got to try you never knowyeah you're trying to get into the finalagain Stakes are high in this heat fiveespecially forGabriella Brian and Bella Kenworthy orjust a few spotsout of being able to shake things upwith Moana JonesWong sitting in that four spot on thebubble she's like please I like yougirls but just keep it chill yeah forsure yeah you've been out here no you'vebeen competing on at pipe for quite along time right I think coms for surewhat was that I don't know if youremember maybe it was your first PipePro they were calling you Newport Noah Ithink remember that it was in the shootout I waslike this guNewport class okay yeah how would youdescribe your relationship with uh withwithpipeline pretty good I think I'm prettyscared of the wave that's Healy yeah ohhere we go Bethy yeah that one was scaryyeah that was her first one she so deepand late and still committed and luckyenough to kick out Annie with these laydrops she's like L dropAnnie how's this one that was scarytoo those are allprobably oh oh man this is like Carnageheat yeah that was some brutal wife outsin that heat I mean they know this islike their last that was sick yeah andfrom the back you get the theperspective of how critical that wavewas yeah I think it shows the size a bitbetter when you leave it in front of itor frombehind man they're sending it they wantit they're like this is my last chancethey got 2 minutes at that finals localbody workers are going to be busy afterbacked up for sure it's going to be hardto get appointmentsyeah even when the cloud comes over alittle bit it just gets a little bitmore scary yeah yeahright you want the sun all over ittotally well if it was a single scoreGabriella would as you see on yourscreen looking for a 27.7 Bella a 29those would be amongst the highest wavesuh scored for the women in all threerounds I was kind of shocked on moana'suh score I thought she was going to geta little bit uh I thought so too notshocked but think relative to I thinkthe 29 and the 209.5 that we'd seen from Molly and Aaronand Aaron yeah I think maybe becausethat they thought it I guess it startedcooking then so they were kind ofkeeping it open but they probably couldhave went a bit bigger it was prettyskits I think yeah yeah I think when itgets bigger too it opens up when thebarrel gets bigger it's hard todetermine maybe she just made it look abit easy to she really did though I meaneven that take off I feel like you canget maybe sometimes people get cruedwithout thinking maybe they could do abit more because they made it look soeasy yeah I mean she has this way thatshe gets to her feet like so quicklythat she almost looks like she Glides inon really critical waves mhm butyeah so it looks like right now in thecurrent top four there are threeprevious Vans pipe Masters yeah WanaCarissaMolly a possibility of a of a two-timefirst or young Aaron Brook Brooks couldjust be like give me that she's notafraid yeah I mean pretty tripping onwhat she's up to I like when she comesout and slams a turn too that backhandone especially 16 pretty heavy so we gotyou know what do you who do you thinkwho do you got for the women'sfinal I think I'm pretty sure it's goingto get bigger and all lefts and fromwhat I've seen I'm probably going to gowith either Moana or Molly and I'm kindof 50/50 on just whoever has a betterheat cuz Molly's pretty nuts right andCH really crazy and I think both of themare actually hunting to get deep and notjust catching waves and survivingthey're pretty up there so well saidMoana too I mean can't she's the best soit'll be one of them too I reckon wellour final is setCarissa Moore Mollypicklum young Aaron Brooks and MoanaJones Wong three Champs and a possiblefirst in Aaron and congratulations toall 20 women in their performances overthe last three days and I think it'spretty safe to say that we we once againwatched the entirety of the of womensurfing get moved way into the future atthis event bunch of SE rides that I seenI was very impressed killer Noah thankyou so much bro excited to see your heatand see some magic out there good luckwith the nerves yeah I'll try to get ridof himsome for to get out there a

appreciateitmoving into the men's absolute Legend ohyeahNoah insanestyle and here weare the the the men have just beenchomping all morning long watching thewomen set the standard and uh big thingsahead every single Surfer has without ashadow of a doubt studied theleaderboard know the scores that existand know the scores that they need as wehave J Quinny Justin quintal Billy keerIMI colani devault and kaai King who uhgraced us with his presence in heatto Billy keer with that big score fromday one at pipeline of a24.80 he knows uh that uhjust one score could be a hugedifference for him he's sitting on a7.60 and a12.50going to beselective who's thiseite GoPro in mouth ohoh no wow that was a good effort towardsthe very end the wave just s that himout I thought there was going to be adog door Billy bil Barrel broken footBilly I got four kids tofeed oh Attitude Change attitude he likeI was all what one way about now he'slike I'm I'm forever heting he's gonnabe sinking the teeth into it today hecan smell it he really really wants tobe in thefinal you know looking back at Billy'swave u in the on the smaller day doingthose turns I was uh speaking to ShayPerkins and we were talking about theway Billy has been ohgreat drop and kind of he's likestalling and then stepping on the gasjust shifter card still on he was doingfull shifter cut in there he Sid fromfirst to third gear installing thenletting go riding the foam ball and thatwas technical had the wave and just givehim that off The Sandbar just shut himdown but looking at Billy we're talkingand oh I was thatdrop Billy is maximizing that efficiencyyou know knowing that he has an injurynot trying to waste any energy and indoing so it seems to be really puttinghim in a great positionto wow so deep yeah I I wish it I'd liketo find out what length he's on todaylike I said 68 before normally he ridesa 6'4 out here might have gone with the66 but that wavewas just technical all the things thatthe judges look for and eat up and againthat that local knowledge you know andhaving the ability to beprecisely selective and knowing what heneeds and he doesn't need much justneeds a 12.4 to throw himself into thetopfour but with the whole field coming inbehind him he wants way more than thatguaranteed or garens if you will he'sgoing to get that and then some on thisscoreyeah we're going to see where that putshim being the first seat that is a bitnerve-wracking as well um just becauseyou'rethe you're the first one you have toeveryone will now know what they needafter you so you're trying to do yourbest you're going in blind trying to getthe biggest best wave you can all rightwell you you saw the women's format forthe day and how it played out let's takea look at how things are going to rollfor the men to get into thefinal[Music]he[Music]$100,000 gross and and and and theability to add your nameto historical figures within the sportof Surfing that have won uh this Vanspipe Master there is a Prestige and alegacy with being able to call yourselfa pipe master and for lifethat's what I think is you can see$100,000 that's a great incentive but tobe called a pipeline Master amongst youlook at the year you won with the peoplewho were invited with you that's againthat's a lifetimeKai charging for his charger chargingfor his chargeroutstanding um ka's bidding for adodged dodg chargeroh and allfinal who Billy scores just in Billykeer with his wave just propelled him tonumber one on the leaderboard boom toldyou kid knew what he needed and what hewanted and Billy keer is our overallleader Quinny coming in smooth styletrying to find thetube people are really taking advantageof the pencildive I feel that wasn't quite a thingbefore it's nice to see people takingnotes yeah and learning how to get outof Harm's Way that part it's not justfor Aesthetics it's literally for safetyyeah uh Justin Quinny J Quinny uh a aliving legend longboard worldchampion from Florida and he's he'sstarted off as a shortboard as a kid andhe said he started longboardingspecifically just so he could surf moreas you seeKa pulling up and under but he's sendingit look at that technique he just getswallowedup Jquenny went for a bit longer board hereoff the bottom and seeing no thank youI'm out of here he really loves surfingPipeline and he Compares he Comparestube riding to nose riding cuz he saidnose riding you're basically gettingbarreled and he he feels like if you cannose ride well it gives you anopportunity to be able to play in thebarrel I mean look at the this year'sWorld Champion longboard Champion kaisAlis uh an incredible tube Rider on thelongboard uh back door andpipeline Jay quiny got he's got a greatquote he says pipeline is like a toxicrelationship you just can't get awayfrom it every time you want to turn yourback it's just right there calling yourname and breathing down your backyeah stillthere now we're getting into this veryinteresting part of that's make thisformat so unique right would think aboutit after day one we had MikeyFebruary uh safe in that top spot andthen in Came John John to be like I'lltake it from here now if you looking atthe leaderboard Mikey has slid intothird place of course he still got uh aheat to go but uh the big question whoamongst the top four right now is Billyjust slid into the top spot uh is goingto be in the final at the end of the dayif you couldpick the names that are definitely goingto be in there from this top four whowill itbe Imean it's it's a it'sa it's hard I I don't even know if Icould choose especially with the wavesthat we have this right now probablygoing to be a lot different by the timewe get to the final don't get me wrongBilly's wave right now so far itdeserves that it's a it was incredibleridemhm is that going to be enough for todaywhen you got people like Mason ho whoare going to be grabbing all the brailsof the board in the barrel and throwingpieces and shakas Benji Benji doublestalling deep on balls Seth going upsidedown fins free drops on back door I Idon't know Eli bar I mean matah oh yeahImean Billy said oh you think that's notenough watch this he's like gothis I got kids to feed four ofthem four ofthem oh and something backdoor I think those I think the cheersthat we heard from the beach wereprobably from Mimi wow and the and thedouble hands behind the back in thatclose out looked like a subtle claim soit'll be interesting to see what justwent place what went downi and what hasbeen mostly a quiet back door thismorning I mean there is coach allright I mean that could be youknow oh let's see let'ssee pumping in it oh[Laughter]oh let's go oh he didn't even need astraight he's likewhat look at thatthingreminiscent that's like Slater Vibeslike five sectionsyeah that was an exchange so Billy outhere's on his left pullingin nice oneyeah wow that's a great greatpositioning you know it's almost one ofthose things you're like w how likewe're here in the hole looking at thescreens and then we see look at frombehind oh all the way to the drop lookat that perfect perfect split Peak soupmy favorite soup splitpeek oh Emi guarantee is getting blastedUPI about to make bigjumps in theleaderboard I want to see that waveagain you can't see that waveenough woo waiting on scores huge scorehuge has to be has to be 29 28 29 wasthat the best wave of the comp I thinkso I mean to agree I would agree look atthisone four five section six that's likethe Kelly wave yeah you know it's like Khunt with his weight he really got usall broken on now how we measure backdoor so take that K hunt wave out ofyour brain right the one from gums allthe way across to rock pile and look athow amazing that wave is I I agree Ithink that's probably the best bestBarrel so far look at thisthing oh GoPro angle's going to be sickand you know you gotthe with the spit all the thedrama and then this is my favorite claimso far was the hands behind the backinto the close out yeah he's like I'mjust going for another one look at thecrew everyone stands out what's goingHolly what mate what oh man look atHolly H is right up oh hands on was thatwas that a Mikey February that clippedin yeah there he is Mikey as wellgetting fired up a that's what we camefor you know that makes you want to sayoh I was going to saydon't forget aboutEmi well we said so at the verybeginning oh yeah no he's he's a threatin allconditions I mean and he's he's comingin with the Swagger just requalified forthe championshiptour yeahthat's people are getting fired upnow and yeah you know he caught two ofthe best waves in the event last yearbothlefts so now he's like oh I got tobalance itout yeah it's uh there's going to besome upsets today oh for sure or what'sthe opposite of upsetssome oppositeDowns down downLS on the VIP headset someone who has tobe fired up right now young Emo CAC howare you you sir Yana Yana I'm good wavesarefiring how does this wave compare toyour homeBreak um it's different because there'salso a right and it's uhmore I don't know it's more kind of allover the place but it's less gnarly Ifeel like but it's such a sick wave it'sone of my favorite wave in theworld you know we talk a lot about uhthis this connection of relationshipbetweentoo and and and the NorthShore what whatis it about these two places andcommunities that make it have this likefamily connection uh it's crazy when I'mhere I feel like I'm home um it's likeeveryone is so cool like home and and Idon't know how to explain it's justeveryone is respectful and and the waysare so good and it's really powerful tookind of like home too so it's definitelygreat to be heresuper stoked to be in this event andwaves are firing right now so couldn'task for more Mason ho calls you thesubmarine because you don't see whereyou are in the lineup but you're alwaysgetting under the sickwaves what's your what's your Techniquehow do you lay low but still get surfI'm always kind of sitting undereveryone and kind of looking for thebest wave um I like to to move a lotwhen I'm surfing and yeah that's it'spretty much my strategy moving a lotaround and finding the good waves staybusy and brother how are things at homewith the reef uh and the developmentthere how do you feel about that do youhave do you want to share some someideas about that um it breaks my heartto see all of that it's there I don'tknow if you guys saw the live of Cindyuh a week ago but they were breaking thereef by just petting the boat over thereand they haven't even start to put thetower so that definitely breaks my heartand all the construction and stuff it'sreally hard for us but hopefullyeverything works out perfectly and andthere's not not too much damage becauseit's already starts to be a lot sohopefully there's no more damage and andwe can save the hoop yeah that is ourour absolute hope it is the mostimportant thing you you have been uh ina very interesting situation in yourHeats here at the at the pipe Mastersand that you you got not one not two butthreeflorenes uh H how have they beentreating you in the Heats are theyboxing you the out like what's going onit's so cool because we're all friendsand we all laugh at the on the line upand stuff but it's definitely reallyhard to get good waves because there'sno priority so so and I kind of see themas as my favorite Surfers so it's kindof hard to put myself into like I'mgoing to go but I definitely need to dothat on my next hit and I definitelyneed to show that I can get big scorestoo because I haven't really showednothing yet so I really hopefully nextit is the one your style has beencompared to John John's style backsidetube riding is that something that youyou studied or are you aware of thisJohn is always has been my biggestinspiration in surfing and uh it'spretty crazy to be against him I meanwith him in a heatand even like to see him surfing it'scrazy and his style is what I havelooked up to when I was younger so if ifyou guys think that I kind oflook it's a goodthing well listen we'll let you go uhand and get prepared it's going to be aa heavy heat especially since Nathanjust got knocked out of the top fourhe's down in the fifth place so yeahit's definitely going to be an hard hitlet's see what take char happen yeahgood luck brother okay thank you have agreat dayMaru yeah it's so great to see the thetahan contingent come up hereum reallybelieving in protecting their home butalso wanting to Showcase alongside thepeople here well look at this IM KalaniDevol wow just shooting who's this kaischarging who let'sgo oh finish it bro finish itmore wowokay what was he is STO oh Quinny let'sgo Quinny drive it oh wowow everyone'sholding their breath it's like droppingin what's going todo all right so I guess I got a littletoo emum when we were talking about what thepotential score was for Emi because hegot a25.9 as I was being like 28 29 what didImiss I I don't maybe there wasn't asmuch spit in the wave maybe it's adifficult view from the judgingTower light them up internet what's yourheavy oh well that's why we're notjudges yeah exactly we are emotionalyeah and I guess the judges are not intheir emotions like us will beinterested to see what this is incompared to Billyright now we're going to know okay maybeit's that was a great wave he must beyou know he he came in just to be a partof it throwing praise His Stoke and toget a wave like this oh he must be sopumped he said he had he brought whatseven eight boards in his car justbecause he knew conditions would bechanging looks like he went with alittle bit morelength we do a big shout out to Sho ohand look at Quinny just oh that wouldhave been so nuts oh he almost kind ofmade it looked like he just tripped upat the end almostthere kind of did a a wiggle pump itfalls right there yeah he was on thatbig Cadillac for areasonamazing wow Stakes are high great visionright there the foam ball just caughthim at the end look at him just at theend man good effort though think mighthave been an equipment an equipmentadjustment to probably thinking about itoh what did I what was thatdo that one's going to give him it beinghis dreams forsure isthatu littlequad quad action maybe the the judgesare keeping the scores low because itcould potentially be getting better Imean I don't know man backwards I I Ididn't think that that that wave was a25 me neither but whatever moving onkeep your head up you got to keep itgoing and even if the women had highscores in their heat like judgeaccording to eachheat yeah yeah right just like we didthe last two days right the the the Idon't know again I'm not a judge I'mjust an emotional surf fan who happensto have a microphone attached to hishead that'sall that's all that's the level of myskill set in this conversation so I willball back 5 minutes and 23 seconds to goWilliam keer still has rooms got sittingon two scores uh above 20 you know he'dlike to take that14.20 and send it upwards Emi alsoplenty ofroom first heat of the men's and alreadya shift in the leaderboard top two yeahwe knew it was going to be it's going tobe like Sun Sunday at atAugusta yeah this is thisis now every are starting to look at Ithink they're really started thinkingabout their equipment it's going to seebe interesting if Mason's going to doanother fake out tell us he's riding the92 and ride the 49 oh you know he'sstressing right now trying to figure outwhat he's going toride billy lay drop first wave of theheat showing everyone it's pipeline timeI mean that was all the things rightcritical drop incredible line Choicedrivingthrough out of I won't even call that adoggy door that was a garage door 'swave here it is again pumping runningthrough thesections yeah allright 's wave yeah we see you judges weseeyou they're just leaving theroom Great Wave great job what did heget on thatthing 19 I think19 this would have been a huge one thatwould have been a huge score if Quinnycould have flowed through that foam balland snuck out I'm sure chrisop funk gotan insane shot of that looking into theeyeball oh forsurethree minutes togo no one's safe as you describedeveryone that's coming for this firstheat and you know I I know Billy he'sjust like I need one just one more letme get rid of this 14 yeah yeah I meanEmi is in the fourth he's probablylooking for somethingtwo just a better backup you know thethese guys arehungry and look none of the total scoresright now are even at the 60 point rangeas as conditions change the possibilityof somebody walking out with three 320sit's not that hardtotally going out JoyJohnson the working mans people'schamp definitely going to be lookingback doorto thread someneedles but then again you look at Mayif if they're looking at judging scoresis the judging or the score potentialeven there if there if the back door isnot getting rewarded as much as mylike questions questions questions andyou know this top 10 herecurrently they're definitely gettingpumped yeah everybody from 5 to 10 couldjust has the potential to go full fullyflared and then there's there's peoplethat aren't in the top 10 that are justsitting on one scores now the the onescores have all been erased now we'relooking in double score right world sothere's the single score people like howBilly was that was way down uh in therankings you know Matas MAA Jam o HarryBryant Amo kaana berky yeah umthey they could all could all could allmake ithappen we see some lines out the backwith just a minute togo will they get here in time to shufflethings up evenfurther seee some movement in the lineupas theyare seeing it aswell looks like Billy's going to optBilly going for one more just to put anail in thatcoffin pocket ride but probably notgoing to make a difference in his scoreline yeah but he probably did the mathrelative to how much time wasleft hold the door oh just sending ittrying toget20 secondsleft see the new heat 10 seconds secondsto go I would just send it even if thething Rings whatever it's your last[Music]chanceoh that will be thatso Billy and Emi have done all they cando if you're Emi you are especiallystressed in that fourth spot the chancesof that holding prettyslim asthe this well only continues to build ohthat would not be fun to duck dive atallno so you know um Mikey and Emiwell Mikey still has a chance Emi that'sthis is his last chance he's hopingfor he's hoping for it to go flat yeahif you're Mikey and you s that back doorwave of IM you're just you're skippingyou're like when when when when can itbe my turn um we talk about the $100,000and but the The Prestige of being ableto to say that you are a pip Master lookat how Exquisite these trophies havebeen designed I meanoh cast bronze by uh an incrediblenative Hawaiian thinker philosopherartist Solomon Enos we have therepresentation here of namaka okah uhone a massive battle between this oceangoddess and her sister the fire goddessPelle and you can see here in thisperpetual motion of energy there existsthe ability to create and Destroy comingfrom within a big Mahalo to Solomon foryour contribution to this and providingthese contestants of such an amazingpiece of history and how art howwonderful yeah to have that thatbeautiful power of the cultureintegrated into this trophy MahaloSolomon good luck to the competitors aswe're moving into heat two of roundthree oh and here we go round three Heat2 leaderboard shshifting Calla Kenny makukyman now they're there these are thepeople you want to be talking aboutthese conditions two Surfers who arevery familiar with the inside of heavingPipeline and back door they more thanknow more than know theyknowoh what do we have here a leaderboardchange we are uh men's round three heattwo in thewater MikeyWrightRTOruo in Black Joey Johnson in red and andLuke Eddie IO champ shepardson is inthird I'm many in fourth in his heatright now with only an 8.30 in his scoreline allSurfers Mikey Wright may have a chancewith his 20po high score but he needs toreplace those two low scores forsure anduh well I mean there's 30 Point ridesthat could have happen so I meantechnically you could be in last placeand get three perfect scores and beshoot right up into contention oh yeahand you could also win this round be atop of the leaderboard first place andstill get fourth in the final so justbecause you won the preliminary roundsmeans absolutely nothing it gets Reedeverybody gets slate Clean Slate back tozero go back to your traditional stylesingle elimination for thefinals and thatwill be uh going down this afternoondecide the PIP master champion thisyeah what an excitingday beautiful surf on top waves arepumping y it's 4to8 at least it went up from earlier was0to8 that last set was probably one ofthe biggest ones I've seen it was one ofthe bigger ones it was more North wehave a on the inside is that Luke thatis Luke shepardson that wave just gotway too small for anexit Luke's going to be wanting to lookfor a much bigger wave I mean look howpristine that water is and what do youthink causes that that small exit whatdo you think causes the wave to thebarrel to shrink and shrink and Shrinktowards the end this is the direction ofthe wave if it's a double up or not ifit's a little North Insider like thisit's uh beautiful positioning he wasright therewe'll see from the side how close he wasone pump right there one more pumpcoming up yep there it is and look likehe just got caught up on that fo ball hejust couldn't ride over that foam balllike I said if there's more room for himto move in that Barrel definitely wouldhave had a better chance of exiting thebarrel so what do you think is the besttrick for getting over that foam ballthe best trick yeah a pump wouldprobably be the best uh or just like geta little bit higher cuz the foam ball isgenerally try you know when you hit thefoam ball you try and usually stay aslight on your feet as possible you don'treally want to push too hard becauseyour board washes out from under you isthat cuz you push and then the fins digdeeper into that foam ball and it couldjust yeah well the foam is is air so itstarts to cavitate the fins it starts toair rate the face of the wave it's notsmooth anymore right so there's there'sair under there so your board's going tomove it's not going to be stuck to cleanwater at the face so when you hit thatit's very turb Brant and um you know toget through that you have to have eithera longer board or a lot of speed you gofrom riding a little pony to uh being ona bucking ball oh yeah with your handsstuck in the strap not being able to getout well I think wehave man who got himself into fourthplace in that heat my brother eay colanidevault with Holly down on the beach heman so what do you think easier to thehighest single wave score and uh yousitting in Forth how safe do you feelheading into the rest of the day I I'mreally happy of course to to just get areally good wave and uh I was lookingfor the right the last like three roundsso uh finally came to me and I was justso excited to be pumping through a waveand yeah I'm in fourth so and beingfirst heat like now it's just a waitinggame all day a bit stressful cuz it wasthe same thing that happened to me lastyear I moved up and then had to watchand move down so hopefully hopefully Ican stay there but longDaye and uh if anyone's going to take aspot throughout the rest of the day whodo you think it's going to be and I Idon't even know I'm not even sure who'sahead of me um but yeah there's so manygood waves I think it's going to be acrazy day so it could easily you knowguys can get some crazy ones so we'llsee uh I got a bag of cash foryou what are you going to spend this oneon the B Vault um man pay my filmermiles over here soyeah this is this is yours Mouse Stubeautiful a thank you so much have agood rest of your day thank you Hollythank you Emi um all smiles it reallydoesn't look like people need much tochange that whole entire leaderboardright there I mean one pumping heat canreally shake up one pumping heat andit's a wrap for a lot of these guys alot of these guys have 20 point scoreline so if they get two waves I mean inmy opinion that Emi back door wave wasunderscored compared to what we've beenseeing he was deep he was super deeptraveled for a long time anduh I've seen a score comingearlier that I'm notsure how they're scoring the right andthe left but I'll tell you what he mightcolani nonetheless got into the top fourwith that wave and he got all absolutehammersfrom 5ifth to 10th just biting at hisheels biting at Billy's heels I meaneverybody's got a 21 a 20 a 24 a 23 19sI mean it really is anybody's game rightnow between first and 9th I would sayit's probably going to be the biggestshake up unless somebody comes in andjust catch two absolute screamers intheir heat which is totally possible ona day liketoday yeah definitely I mean you seethere like even in the women's side alot a lot of those scores right therewouldn't even have made it into the topfour yeah now the women's got a lothigher scores in their score lines anduh definitely throwing away how how dothe judges judge between men and womenKK what's the difference like how how dothey get higher scores on not as good awaves I would say and then the men getsome screamers and get lower scores whatwhat is the scale do you do you knowwhat what the deal with that is uh Idon't really know what the scale is youthat you'd have to ask the the judge isabout thatyeah I just see that uh it's definitelyjudged differently yeah you could tellsamewave same competition differentscoring curriculum from men towomen and uh right now with 18 minutesleft on the clock these guys better putit intogear if they are wanting to get into thetop fourfour you see on your screen Mikey rightinblueruo in Black Luke shepardson in whiteJoey Johnson in red with very veryminimal scores pretty much all acrossthe board until you get to MikeyWright's 20 point score which was abeautifulright first day and we'll see what theycan bring herelittle lull inaction swell is on the risethough so we are going to see some bombsthisafternoon we will see some bombs thisafternoon I hope it's looking kind ofslow it's it's definitely uh slowlycoming up it did a little youknow little paulse for a second thereyou go there's your beach scene downhere at Pipeline on the NorthShore ofwho you are watching the van pipeMasters 2023 don't go anyway we willreturn shortly see yousoon I was 23 at the

obviously I'd been over inIreland but it was a shock put it thatway I'm paling out there like this wateris a bit different you know like youkind of showing me how to like put a Leastring on correctly Etc so I was a fullcook did you sell them did you sell themon any any bad ones no we wouldn't dothat to our friends like that especiallythere because you sell someone on a badone out there it could be their last badone that's true and um I mean Tommy justcame back from a big injury in Tahitiwhere you know like we were sayingearlier you don't want to just jump overthe fall sometimes at certain spots oncertain waves because there'sconsequences to be paid for not ridingit out or charging it all the waythrough yeah yeah we we want to makewaves don't we that's the that's thegame plan um and over the years I'velearned the hard way to be patient andpick my ways pick pick my battles pickmy swells but I'm still learning andgrowing and yeah I definitely nearlydied and came back oh we got some actionout the back this could be a perfect 10if he makes it wow please come out yesoh oh God it just CL you got to give himpoints just for that I mean just to makeit to where he made it right there 30Point ride in the making I I say if hedoesn't get 20 points just for that ridemake or not I mean oh man that wasincredible that was literally theheaviest drop I've seen like so far youand you know a trip is you're going toget see guys get way higher scores he'sgoing to get a minute score for that androl out the gnarliest part of the wavedid everything he could fortunately itcloses out I mean watch this justabsolutely charging gets hung up look atthose pumps one twoo I mean you can'tget any deeper than that at pipelineperiod riaru riaru is literally one ofthe Gest guys though he's sending itevery year I mean he took off under thelip I mean look at this look on the foball look you can't get any deeper likeI said he was we were just talking aboutriding the fo ball he executed thatperfectly he was making it too like hewas making it just that wave went itjust clamped it clamped him at the end Imean wow look at that you see the yousee that section just close out rightthere I mean there was there has notbeen a bar that good period this wholeevent that was the best Barrel R if Iwent out there this morning and therewas no contest got that I'm stoked I'mgoing home babe I sent it on one I gotone wav my win you know what I mean soexactly good on him good on him I meanthat's got to be in my opinion the bestBarrel riding so far um I didn't say thebest Barrel made obviously he's notgoing to get rewarded as a make you gothrough all of that and you get a 3.5 a4.5 a4.7 look at that broken boy is that thegnarliest 4.7 or 3.5 you ever seen Idon't know some I think we've been inJaws together in a heat and there's someweird stuff going on you know that bigwave stuff again you you know you sendit you packit but you know you know what I've seenover the years honestly I'm going to bestraight up with it judges judge onnames as well because I've seen guys getjust as good of waves if not better witha different name and you didn't get thescore I'll say it I don't careyou can brother the judges do givescores for names and I've seen itforever it's a good marketing thing andjust just just what how it is I guessbut right here let's look at that againwow take no credit from this man righthere he justabsolutely God do you think if he wouldhave like straightened out right thereand tried to doggy door there's nothinghe could have done about what he didlook right there though right therethough he need extra needed anothercouple I mean he probably would have gotlipped in the head but the safest thatshot's going to be insane from the waterjust that vision is insane to pumpthrough that and ride through that it'salmost like Aladdin on his magic carpetjust you know he's running away from allthe guys look at look at all thespectators going everyone's La it's likewhen he trying to come out of the Caveof Wonders and the cave closes down onhim and the lamp goes flying on he staysin as uh here we go Mikey right this guyrips yeah I love watching this guy sirone my favorites seamless look at thatno grab comingout style Mikey is an animal yes he cameover to Ireland actually a few times andyeah I seen some footage talk to usabout that Ireland wave how does itcompare to pipe and jaws and stuff likethat that big left I mean it's hard tocompare right they're all their ownbeasts but there's some similarities Iguess between like Fiji when it doesoutter Reef okay I'd say except it'smaybe easier to position at mmore soyeah it's a bit easier as far as likeit's more of a slab than a giant sort ofout Reef VI but you know when you're outat Fiji when it's massive it's hard toit's like Jaws you you're looking aroundand you're like whoa this is some bigocean where am I going to get caughtinside next yeah exactly all right youguys I I want your I want your input onthis what do you think looking back atum Mikey's wave and talking about nograbs grabs backside what do you thinkisharder no grab no grab but you know yeahI mean if you you take off and do nograb like Kelly Slater style but you seethe difference is it was no grab to agrab because a lot of the times the nograb is for the big pump in thebeginning control yourself in the barrelwith the grab and a lot of the timespeople like oh he did it no grab we'reactually grabbing in the barrel comingout no grab you know what I mean so it'sit's it I just think no all the way ifyou go no no no grab then really talkingESP no grab all the way late it's lateand sometimes it's easier but becausesometimes when you're super late and youhaven't committed to the grab you haveto no go no grab because once you leanforward your nose curls I'm very good atthat if you're not on that back foot andgetting under the lip you're probablygoing to Pearl really hard but here'sLuke sheperson and he's showing you onceagain that pump whoa W wo wo wo buddythere you go barel man there's a no grabthere's a no grab I kind of stalled himkind of perfect that little Bobble atthe beginninghow about Mason's ho like grab to fronthand grab like switch hand grab yeahdragging that back leg off the back ofthe let's go Joey oh oh so close it'sright there come on that end section isreally I want to see one of these boysjump the foam ball cuz all the otherscores have been like perfectly riddenlike kind of in the pocket these guysare getting sevens and eights for Iwonder what they're going to grab giveonce you see the guy come jumping overthe foone ball like these guys beendoing this last year I thought Billy'sLast Ride was pretty sick and late butlike you say he rode it perfect but itmaybe wasn't the right wave to do thefoone ball grab yeah boy you he wasright where he needed to be on that wayexct I think if it would have beendeeper it would have been hard to doggydoor and you see how the guys aregetting pinched yeah so that's what I'msaying maybe the wave's not cooperatingyet maybe is that what you meanpositioning is is key but if you do getdeep and over that foam ball and thenyou come out the doggy door that's gotto be on a difficulty scale level it'sgot to be way up there you know so itwould be pretty cool to see the guyscome through hit those foam balls jumpover them and actually exit the barreland we yet to see our first perfect10-point ride it's coming it's comingit's pumping it's filling in swellsfilling in it's only going to get betteryou know now Mak when you take off onthose waves um like the one we sawbefore that incredible ride can you seeall the way down the line at the end ofthe barrel whether it's going to clampor not oh yeah you can pretty much see Imean when you're coming see you'relooking down the line to see what'sahead of you so when you're lookingyou're kind of seeing this section overhere come at you so you kind of knowokay I got a little bit of time I got togo high you want to try and go a littlebit high to low so you get that speedcoming out and sometimes it's just kindof you got to get out like I said yeahlook at him he was he was on the phoneball yep it seems like that sandbar thatpushed in with that n swell is giving itthat little runoff at the end and if itwas deeper it was a big West swellbefore this and then this swell camethere would be no sand there and thatwave would hold all the way through itwouldn't do that that clamp at gumsclamp yes well hopefully that'll be in acouple of weeks when everyone bailswe're out there brother I'll see youthere oh yes we will be there there'sgoing to be more not even a couple ofweeks maybe in a few days after tomorrowit's over yeah like christas Christmasis looking interesting to is our lastday we got now into the back doorshootout right yeah Eddie what else wegot comingEddie we got a lots contest we got a lotof SW wellc coming hopefully I meanthey're talking El Nino this and thatbut it's Midway through December haven'tseen a look kind of L to me well nowthey're saying late you know she'scoming late yeah yeah yeah they say alot of things that's what happensnowadays too much talking even in herehere comes some uh action yeah here wego yeah give us action once upon a timewe woke up when we said how's the wavesgoing to be I'll tell you tomorrow callyou in the morning old school yeah wellat least we had that era at least we allhad that era I'm thankful for thatsometimes forecasting can get trickybecause you know it's a really educatedguest it's not guaranteed yeah and uhsometimes you know I feel like theythrow guys off too oh there's a swellover here too and then that one wasn'tthat good but some reason over here ispumpy no one heard aboutit yeah we got surprised that last weekwell didn't we like two weeks ago I justlanded and it was supposed to be likemediumsized I woke up in the morning togo and check the waves and there waslike no Road it was just sand and waterand I was like okay like all right it'sone of them is it EXA we got a paddlerighthere who is this is that Luke Mikeyright oh pumping down the lineoohnice little oldbarrels oh is he going for a doublebonus oh not there that that end sectionis unforgiving that is thegobler it's like pipeline's version ofhaliva toilet bow section right goodcall yeah I mean looks like the toiletboy at haliva just sand and that'swhat's kind of you see at halivasometimes there's these big ones theycome together and like Oh and it justkind of mushes out kind of what it'sdoing right now here at pipeline it hasuh Mikey right only means a 14.4 to getin that top fourspot I mean 14.4 that isnot that much and right here this couldactually be a 14.4 I mean that's onlywhat less than five across the boardyeah 15 would be fives so Imean yeah I think very possible he gotthe score on thatwave we will have to see oh niceone he's just cruising isn't he socomfortable oh yeah look at this guy nohand pump I like that no hand pump rightthere oh that that gives you a lot moremotion that gives you a lot more rangeof motion to pump your board when you'regrabbing you only can grab so much whenthe wave's bigger you can do a betterpump with the grab but smaller waveslike this you see how he came off thebottom what's going to grab let go andreally use that Rail and his arms todrive get that line and once he set hisline you see that little chandeliercoming held on for a second right herelook really almost grab and no grab atthe same time pump holds on right therejust to make sure he comes through theturbulence and the perfect way toexecute that ride by Mikey right not alot of people know that uh you know whatthe no grab is for it's actually toposition yourself it's actually so thatyou can move around and pump cuz onceyou grab the rail you're kind of lockedin in the rail it's kind of hard untilit Mellows out towards the end and thereyou go 15 points Mikey Right Moves toFourth and eay Kanani is now out of thetop four wow and that last ride from emowas insane I was so pumped for him buthe just need to get one more that's howit goes he needed to get one more ohmaybe he's not out Mikey Wright still inninth we got to get the true facts inhere before we starttalking Maka with the blah blah blahblah blah blah blah blah sorry guys Ithought I was K Dracula right there inuhTransylvaniawhat no you know and his what's hisdaughter say blah blah blah blah blahblah BLblah no there it is Mike is infourth I was right he is infourth technical difficulties on thebackside waiting for this graphic toupdate and uh today's schedule as yousee will follow to maximize the bestconditions we will reduce heat times to28 minutes so 2 minutes less thanprevious Heats finals to 40 minutesinstead of an hour so 20 minutes off thefinal run of show women's Heats 1through five which we finished we're inmen's heat to now next will be thewomen's finalswomen's pipe Mastercrowning men's Heats 3 through 10 men'sfinal and then the award GE willfollow so once again tomyo if you don'tknow the name now you do one of theabsolute crackers when it comes to BigWave someone that does not know the wordpull or back do not exist in hiscategory in his vocabulary we love youso much thank you for joiningus for all the years of being wavesurfing together we appr you for all theAloha over the years brother and lovetomm yeah we appreciatewe have a little bit of motion in theocean anduh5 25 seconds on the clock which meansthis wave and possibly the next one andthat is awrap 15seconds we will have a wave approach usprobably with about 5 Seconds to golet's see if somebody can scratch intothis one three but it's just a junk waveyeah no yeah there it is and that is allshe wrote ladies and gentlemen MikeyWright coming inclutch andstealing that fourth spot supposedly ithasn't updated yet souh we're waiting on that but MikeyWright isnow in fourth there we go it has hasbeen updated Billy keer leading the packJohn John Florence in second MikeyFebruary in third and Mikey Wright hasjust squeak into that fourthspot we have a lot of Surfing sevenHeats of mens to go so this leaderboardI am guessing I'm going to go out on thelimb and say it will not be the same asit looks now after this women's finalwe'll get back into men's competitionsHeats three through10but right now in the water we do havethefinals CarissaMoore fromHawaii I think that should say Molly puminstead of Molly Molly Good Golly MissMolly though goly Miss Molly pick themshe is picking them pick know how pickthem she was picking off AaronBrooks is in this heat as well and MoanaJones wall your current Queen ofpipeline is out there defending hertitle against one namali pum who wouldlove to just take that off of her handsand hang it on her wall you see she isnot giving her too much space out theresitting right on the inside cornerreally a smart tactic uh sitting kind ofpositioning behind Moana like thatbecause you can let Moana commit andbecause there's no priority whip aroundbehind her if it's a good one andactually take the wave off of heras you can see Carissa Mo opting for themore inside position looks like shewants to hunt those rightand barrels atback door that we've been seeing we'veseen uh IM colanidevault get an absolute cracker and AronBrooks is going tobe look it to me like could be thefirst 16-year-old Pipeline Masterschampion for thewomen maybe the Young pipe Master evershould she take out this heatyeah yeah there's there's a there was afew16-year-olds in this event on thewomen's side 16-year-old who won a pipeMasters no no I'm but I'm saying in thisevent oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeahthere's been a few 16year olds butthere's only one in the finals that'sright there's only one that's got achance right now to become history a16-year-old pipe Masters and uh we willsee Moana Jones wrong is not giving upat all she is going to battle it out tothe very end Mollypicklum can't say enough about thisyoung woman's performance out here wasabsolutely on a tear and I mean KarissaMoore is the queen ofAloha Olympic gold medalist multi-timefive-time world champion right anduh you know right now that man rightthere is looking to represent hav onemore time as she always has done sograciously so ferociously in the waterbut on the land she is the most graciousmost Aloha sweetest person you couldever meet and uh we love Carissa so muchthank you for representing AI from eachand every one of us here in hav we thankyou sister for spreading that Aloha forus around theworld um oh there looks like there ispriority in the women's finals yeahthat's going to why would they want toruin the contest like that by puttingpriorityoh it's the problem in surfing right nowand this is just my opinion it's weakwhen there'spriority well they're definitely goingto have to change their strategies up alittle bit when that priority is inplace that changesthings yep you got to be a little moreselective on our roll we have KarissaMoore looks like she is just going toabsolutely oh that looked like anattempt so I'm not sure how that workswith priority but I think she would bein last priority now right she missedthat one that's what I don't like aboutpriority is when I paddle for a wave andmiss it and then you go back of the lineshe's the champ maybe we'll just leaveher priorityalone and then Molly p is not playinggames oh shoot that was an upside downdrop what a Comm she hit her head on thefront of the board ah she's got a helmeton looks like she's uh thank God she gotthat helmet on yeah looked like she'sgot her board and she's up and she'sgetting back out there one more out theback who is this Mo Jones Wong that'sright oh sister could have done deeperon that one nice effort double barrel ohwow what a beautiful takeoff I meanthese girls are just absolutely knifingit they are under the lip yeah wow k ithe level has gotten so much better inthe last couple years now that the womenhave had these opportunities to actuallycompete in the pipe Masters you know forthe first time started three years agoand you've justwatched the level just blowup yeah um I think we have uh we havestanding by the man himself Mr MikeyWright who got himself into that fourspot down on the beach with Holly Mikeyhow's it going hey Mike uh feel like Ikeep asking this question but uh you'vemoved up into fourth how safe you feelon heading into the rest of theday ah I'm not really thinking about itto be honest I was just stok to get acouple waves no one out but um but yeahit would have been nice to get a properset and maybe get another 20 on theboard but anyway uh I think it's justgoing to get better all day so I don't Idon't see it happening but anywayfingers crossedn I'm not even hoping I just it was justgood to get a few waves it'd be sick toget another heat in the final but butyeah that's that's a long day and it'sjust going to get better and betterso excited to watch yeah it should begood should be a good day of actionanyway maybe might go see that off thewall did you you reckon you had a chairno all right you have a sick of your daymate than oh listening to Aussies talkto each other have to be one of thegreatest things ever I love myAustralian Ohana they're uh like I saidit's like home away from home for methere and they got to be some of themost essential characters on planetEarth they bring the fire they bring theheat they bring the competition theybring the jokes and they bring the loveas well so thank you Australia each andevery one of you out there supportingyour brother Mikey Wright it's speak acompetition makua let's explain to ourviewers that aren't familiar with thepriority how it gets established how youget it how you lose it I think we shouldlose it alltogether Imean so how you get it how you lose itsupposedly when you paddle for awave you lose priority right off the batso but at the beginning of the heatthere's no priority yeah but if you makea committed effort to the wave you'lllose priority right you have to pad whenyou paddle and make a committ effort digwhen you dig that's an eff then it'swhoever catches the wave first gets lastpriority yeah and so on and so forth soif you're the last person to Catch theWave you will be in last priority or ifyou were the last person to paddle for awave and miss it you also get booted tothe back of the L yeah see it's I meanit's just so confusing just let thesurfer surf battle it out and it's one Lthing some technical Hogie Boogie yougot to think about yeah priority thepriority stuff always threw me off cuz II would I would get it confused in myhead I'd be like wait is it my turn Ikind of paddle for that wave am I backof the line uh did did that girl catch awave am I next yeah especially with fourpeople and and a wave of consequence cuzshould you be dropping in deep on thatthat like a boy from Japan's wave hejust caught and then well you can justdrop it on his head just cuz you gotparty that's actually more dangerousthananything but here we go I meanabsolutely charging that was a gnarlywipeout wow I mean she just took that like achamp too Molly picklo let's go and thenhere we go smooth assilk the queen does the queen doing asshe does and just getting absolutelyslotted on this one I mean look at thatside slip on the drop double hand Drslowingdown making it lookeasy Carissa Moore got in on the actiontoo let'son the inside oh Insider technicalthough now look at this Aaron Brookscomeon she was pumping in thatthing wow she was right there look atthat trainer it seems like something'sgoing on cuz we got some clapping heregoes Molly pum that's what it is itis of course look at that head shakeshake it off at come on out smash thelip let'sgoowokay can we please get the right scorefor that onejudges that wasawesome and she put thelittle exclamation point on the end ofthe sentence with that oh definitelymassive definitely massive smashthat wave is going to be if that's a 17for Carissa that's got to be a 27 forwhat's her name cuz uh smash the lip atthe end a bigger wave let's look at itthere we go pulling in with the spitwatch this and here we go with uh bangsee we haven't really seen that allcontest long so we're not sure what kindof scores people are going to get afterpulling in to a beautiful Barrel comingout and smashing thelip look at thatbang upside down on that turn rightthere look atthat such a good backhand Barrelright this girl is the real deal righthereslam slam bam thank youma'am slam bam thank you ma'am I loveit we want to go down to the beach toriaru who rode absolutelysmoker of a wave Holly give us a littleinsight of how he felt riding that waveyeah I'm here with riaru how was uhhow's this feel you got a bag of cashwhat are you going to spend it on yeahum going to buy a car scary there andyeah I found a big set andI P and take off making a huge barel Ilittle bit fumble B like a I found thisuh do like um wowyoh soscary yeah yeah that was great to watchcongratulations thank you so much I meanlook at that the boy was almostspeechless there he uh all he can say isfoam ball and doggy door heavy water itlooks like Molly's score has comethrough at a27.4 oh I'm I should be judging upthere look atCarissa on theright big carving turn yeah that was auh was an all rightwave it was uh she was looking to stalla lot deeper I think on that one whenshe took off it looked like she wantedto pull into that one right off the batit was a little crumbly sh to go aroundit nonetheless got a nice pocket ride atthe end with a nice cut back and lookwho do you[Music]know we have the replay here ofCarissa'swave coming around the corner stallingsee that how it kind of shut down for asecond there nice little pocket ride onthat one nice carve and then she hits alittle turbulence right here and she waslike all right looking a build on that17-pointrideum so Molly Molly did a couple trips toTahiti this year to practice herbackside tube riding do you think it'spaying off whatever Molly did leading upto this vent everything paid off becauseshe is absolutely absolutely on a tearyeah Iagreed and uh looks like we got somelines I seeMoanamjw P girl Moana let's go get in therecome on come on come on that's the rightthere wowso like I was sayingearlier we're going to get some realscores for these waves cuz these aresome real pipeline barrels that wasinsane and the queen said off with herhead it is my turn to show you why theycall me the queen ofPipeline and uh it's going to be abattle right now because m Mollypicklum she doesn't care queen or notshe's there to take your crown and she'sworking hard at it here we go MoanaJones just absolutely getting to asmoker look at that bottom turn pullingit and I mean that was it's the bestwomen's Barrel so far I got to sayyeah on AB driving P absolute bomb lookat the spit she knows she knows rightnext to theboil up and in and that was insanethat's got togo wow look how look that that was oneof the biggest that's 28 29 all dayrightthere so the top two waves are going todetermine the winner in this final sothat is going to be a goodscore that is the score of that is thescore and it'll be 100,000 for firstplace second$75,000 third $5,000 and fourth Miss hewill go home with 25 Grand not bad wowwell looks like uh Moana really wants$100,000 yep it's not going to come easybecause wehave one of the most winning females inhistory in this heat which is CarissaMoore and mly picklum just absolutelychomping at the bit to take one of theseevents out and then you got the futureof the sport Aaron Brooks who she mightnot have got a wave yet but I'll tellyou what she is not going to give upwithout a fight 23 minutes left there'sa lot of time for these girls to changethis heater around and the score is infor Moana it's almost perfect score shegot a 29 point3 uhhuh uhhuh there wegohawaian is infirst amazingSurfing by all these ladies just to getto this top four you have to have surfedamazingly yes like regardless of whathappens you made it into the finals intoone of the most the most technicalcomplicated things to do is go throughround after round after round afterround and perform high enough so thatyou could crack into a final seaty really cool for I love the format forthis event I love the format for theshootoutEddie it's all uh it's all relevant it'syou can watch the best surfer surf theyto Surf all day in all theconditions you know it's it's I thinkthis is the this is the new way this isthe format that needs to be adopted onon the championship to her I would sayso did you knowthat Moana Karissa and Molly are thethree previous women's pipe Masters areall in this heat right now with a new fawith a new Fresh Face 16-year-old AaronBrooks and that face isn't going to gonowhere either she's going to be a faceto remember for a long time Aaron Brooksprobably one of my favorites by far andum sweetest little thing you know she'sjust so dedicated and so respectful andreally takes time out of her day to knowthat it's time to work on her craft evenat a young age or she could be you knowthis or that or you know people are likeoh she's only 16 she's got a lot of timeto grow I think she's just Full SpeedAhead and she knows what she wants andshe's probably going to get ityeahdefinitely so as the oceansubsides here at pipeline giving ourwomen a chance to breathe and to processwhat just went down some of thoseamazing rides coming in first placeMoana Jones Wong second place Molly pumKarissa Moore is in third needs an18.9 and AaronBrooks needs29.9 to get into first and we are goingto bringyou a few replays of of Moana Jones Wongand show you how she got to thisfinals I mean just absolutelythreatening the needle right there onthat[Music]one perfect positioning I mean righthere you can see how comfortable she ison her board yeah she knows what she'sdoing I mean she's smiling all the waythrough that Barrel she's alwayssmiling and they're right here justbehind the section pulls up tight onjust a glassy wave I was going to saythat wave was so glassy I mean justbutter look atthat big Grabel Cy oh this was a sickone righthere spitout beautiful linebeautiful coming from behind like thatand just her positioning is just amazingtiming is impeccable and like I saidright here just showing how comfortableshe is took off behind the lib and justpacked thatthing and look at the smile look at thesmile look at that smile 20 minutes togo check thatout I mean supporters on the beach Ithink that is Bella Kenworthy and SierraKerr if I'm notmistaken I think they have Molly Pam'sboard down there her backup boardgetting it ready for her nice here's afun fact uh Aaron Brooks made the finalin the Pang cup in the men'sdivision she even took out uh Nick vonrum in the semis so beating up on theboys that's amazing we should get thegirls and the boys all in one divisionnext year out here see how itgoes that' be perfect one contest allone together same conditions samejudgingcriteria and uh yeah I mean I remembergetting beat by Cena sore back in thedays oh Cena was at uh I got beat atpine trees by Cena and I beat by BBartel and uh I beat Andy in his firstconest he never forgave me for that oneI don't think anybody will forget thatday but anyways from The PipelineMasters we are here in the women's finalfrom the beautiful Northshore of Oahuthe most beautiful Coast you have everseen aihotoo thank you brother thankyou the inside of pipeline sounds likethis Fairy like a giant diesel enginejust rumbling and grumbling when I gotthat one big wave when it back spit Icould hear everyone whistling andyelling on the beach and it sucked allthe sound in and that was really loudand crazyand I just hear all the screams and Hotsand hollers and whistles just flying byme it was one of the craziestexperiences welcome back live fromPipeline on the NorthShore of Oahu inHawaii we are here at the Vans 2023PipelineMasters while kiala this final is reallyshaping up to be a cracker of a heat wehave some huge scores by Moana JonesWong and Molly picklum but don't forgetyou need more than one score you will bejudged on two scores and Carissa Mooreonly needs an18.9 yeah Mo to overtake that firstplace she's going to need to have abackup you're not going to do it on Wone wave but man she's she's got herselfin a good position to win at all thoughand too many times over the years we'veseen people get too comfortable with a10-point ride and still not even makethe heat wild so I mean it's a it's athingthat it's an unspoken rule that justbecause you did got a 10 does not meananything you definitely need to havesome type of backup score to either getyou into the top spot or get you throughtheserounds and uh it's interesting thepositioning these girls are taking againlooking like Carissa sitting on theinside it's almost like they'refollowing Moana but then they don'treally want the one Moana wants maybeand then it kind of goes down the linelike that because that's the exact samepositioning they had when they startedthis seat Well if they keep leaving itup toMoana Moana is going to take it well youknow what they say the the ocean choseMoana right in the movie and it's kindof like now that wave's coming and herewe have Moana on the ocean anduhyeah what a story too coming from behindto get in that final you know she shewas on the Hanging On The Edge there andthen having Frankie right there about tolike take your spot that's what I meanhaving the waves actually twice and notbeing able to complete the rides I meanwhen she started today Moana was comingfrom behind hoping to get in that thattop four spot she she got there and thenshe was just she had to wait a coupleHeats just to see what everybody elsewas doing she had a couple girls on herheels and now sheshe could be the pipeMaster definitely she's on her way todoing it too she's got a29.3 right now is Moana Jones Wong inthe water in pull position followedright behind just like you see themlined up in the ocean followed by Mollypigum cover some more and we have AaronBrooks Sitting a little wide and in andwe'll see uh how this positioning righthereit it's it's it's interesting to me tosee every time they line up they kind ofline up in the same you know uhformation formation it's it's Moana BaliCarissa but who has priority right nowbecause even though moana's out the backand the bomb might come she if she's ifshe doesn't have priority she's going tohave to atease that's the problem withpriority just because that guy caught awave really means nothing if you go backinto the right position and you're inposition for the next wave you should beable to get down two I'm not sure whatthe priority is right now we don't havea priority indicator here in the uhBooth but uhnonetheless regardless of what happensbig bombs coming through I'm pretty sureMoana Jones long is going to put herselfin position and uh yeah there we go cuzwe see Molly picklum paddling towardsthe back door side of your screenscreen I'm not sure what she sees herebut uh Aaron Brooks also looking on theinside beautiful wave get in thereoh just kind of hit a hit a little snagthere on the drop and had to it's reallytricky when you get to the bottom therebecause if you push too hard sometimesyou Pearl yeah and then as you seenthere she didn't push really hard andshe was able to get that nose to stay ontop of the water you know and kind ofride out into the flats but it's a verytricky situation because itstarts it starts from when you drop inand the way you position your board andwhere you're angling is how you can getyou know into that position but thereyou see your priority judge up there MrMarty and uh Marty Thomas up there nostranger to competitive surfing andcalling these events here at Pipelineand uhlooks like Chris Amar holding for hispriority rightnow you usually read left to right but Imean maybe they got it right to lefthere I'm not sure but I would think bluewould have priority first black and thenred but maybe not maybe it isred I wasn't in the heat[Laughter]briefingbut wow I mean look at how just thespray off of the Waves the texture onthe water I mean the conditions havestayed so nice all day and it's going toget nice and windy andradical towards the end of the day youare going to see some air drops somechandeliers and some very deepbarrels one thing about pipeline is ittends to suck youin you're in the barrel and it likesucks backward and stings your face andthen blows out from behind and you don'teven know where you are and hopefullythere's no guillotine doggy doorsections landing on yourneck but oh you see how her board justkind of got weightless there for asecond she couldn't engage the finsright off the drop hereright there the board disconnects itgives a little bounce if her board wouldhave stayed to the face she would havebeen able to get on that front Rail andturn but right here you'll see it moveright there yeah that's the part whereit kind of got sticky and if she wouldhave pushed right there probably wouldhave lost the fins or dug the nose soshe did a great job technically to pullthat out that was not an easy drop byany means especially the night fit underthe barrel I mean that wave was sickyeah that little snag just messed up thetiming where she couldn't get under thatlip and get in that barrel and pipelineit gets real tricky you see when the howthe water is going across your screenacross our Surfers nose of theirsurfboard that means the winds are alittle bit Northeast and that's going tobring a little side chop into the waveso sometimes you're taking off and ifthat you're behind that side chop I sayyou got to bang that little bumper or goover it as you're dropping into a supersteep spot so it makes it a lot moretricky when you have those side chopscoming across the wave there goes AaronBrooks again just absolutelycharging I think my brothers in the nextHeat next going cracker too JamieO'Brien Makai mam Eli olon CoRothman leaderboardchange but right now we have 10 minutesleft in thefinals and we will be waiting to see whoor if anyone gets that backup scorecompletes a ride and Imean yeah Molly Pikman her backup waveright now is a 1.3 so she definitelyneeds to get rid of thatone yeah I mean um would do you if youwere in her position right now maybe tryand move inside and just get a higheryou know like a mid-range score just tojust no not at all because I think shehas priority if the if I read thepriority screen right but uh she's inthat top three at least priority there'snine minutes left there's absolutely noreason to wastetime when you need a score let's look ather first wave righthere just just charging that's the onewhere she went down so hard that's justwhat happens when you charge hardsometimes you know that's what happensbut there's Moana Jones charging hard aswell that was her first wave silkysmooth just cruising in thatBarrel then we got Carissa Carissa MO ona nice backside smaller insidewave and then right here is the comboNation comingout and then just some Mass massivere-entry off here beautiful you knowwhat they call that right there oh andhere's Moana here's the highest score intheHeat big beautiful Barrel we got a namefor this kind of stuff right here

within 7 minutes I'm prettysure there is going to be a flurry butup next eight more men's Heats then themen's final and that is a wrap for the2023 Vans pipeMasters I hope you all stick with

third and Aaron Brooksin fourth all the surfing that was donethe past few days none of it mattersanymore because right now is the onlything you have been looking for to thiswhole event the finalsand winning and taking home the covetedVans pipe Masters women's title for2023 Molly Pam in second place is sowithin Striking Distance she only needsa small score of an 8.5 to jump in thelead Carissa Moore needing um 18.9 whichwould be easy for Chris amore to pulloff so still anyone's game but that waybyMoana yeah I mean that just like I saidthat was just boom and uh she's uh thequeen of pipeline for areason right now she has three womenright behindher and there is mybrothercorRothman about to get out there with jamyO'Brien Eli Olen and Makai mcamera Imean that is a heat the boys will not

that one of those bingo bango picklemango kind ofthingshuh waiting for a score shehas definitely better a6.5 there's nodoubtbig remaining and look at thatChandelier on your facethe swell does look like it's turning abitnorth look at these sets coming throughthis is going to be an exciting finishMaka it has been anexciting 35 and a half minutes and rightnow with bombs out the back Molly Pam islooking to pick them herself she'slooking to pick one oh yes she is is andif she picks one she has theskill and the goal to be able to make itlike I said the swell is turning Norththat's why you see these wash throughsthis is the swell coming up and as itcomes up this swell is due to be moreNorth so the Heats in the morning mighthave had a lot more Westerly scoringpotential not as much running down thereef and you're going to see these guysthroughout theday the rest of this women seat thatdoggy door is going to be a big factorand either making these waves or notlike we seenearlier with ru's wave still waiting onscores for moana's last wave but thatshould definitely solidify herlead and Mollypum is going to be looking for thatbackupscore B Pam's definitely going to beneeding a score as so as everybodyelse I mean look at that back door in itscoot spitout let say it have to go about the 18ppoint range yeah sixes across the boardright beautiful wave beautifully servedthe positioningjustlook how fast she was going rightthere just very like foot front footvery far forward on the board to getthat speed and she just comes shootingout kicking out into thatbeautiful crystal clearwater commentatorsopinion has Moana Jones had more bigbarrelsthan any woman on earth Kella Kenley doyou think she's got more big brows thanyou I don't think so sorry she mighthave got a lot of

check the replay deep onthe bo strong paddle barely got underthat lip and then just kind of slid outit looked like it was kind of closingout anywaysMoana Queen Moana watch the lip almosttake her head out rightthere by oh a little Bobble in thebarrel right there that's a feeling thatyou'll never forget is falling andwatching The Wave Barrel as you slidedown on yourback wow I mean most guys can't even dowhat she just did right there mosthumans on planet Earth can't get underthat lip and Moana Jones justabsolutely missed the Gby probably fraction of aninch that was impressive here

theemotions are so strong congratulationsMoana Jones w f pip M for2023 I'mspeechless I got so pounded on my lastwave I had to pay for that for the winon that one I was just out there and Iwas just asking Pipeline and God forlike one wave and then I got that waveand then I got another another wave andI was like what I didn't think I wasgoing to win well you're the first twotime pipe master I'm so happy what doesthis mean to her so thankful right nowuh we want to know what this means toyou this means like everything to melike I just love surfing pipe and I Iput I live right down the road and Igrew up right here it's where I'm bornand raised and I never thought I wouldever surf P when I was younger and thenI watched some of my best friends surfout here like M Pang and like B Mia andno B and cl and I wanted to be like themso I started surfing out here and Inever thought I'd becomegood you're damn good uh What are yougoing to spend the money on I don't knowI have no idea I didn't even think aboutthat until right now I just was thinkingabout catchingwaves it thank you sogood thank you Holly and uh I don't knowabout you Dr Kono but they're cuttingonions in here yeah you cannot help butbe caught up in in those emotions andthe key of what she said for me was Ididn't even think that I would ever getto Surf pipelineright yeah what what a what a a graciousChampion Wana Jones Wong to say she'sborn and raised her and herhusband tahande coming in how exciting were thosewaves that she's got I mean it waspretty much night and day Moana surfingcompared to what else was going on outthere itwas it seemed to be that it was her dayit was her day and also I mean shout outto Molly Pam and Karissa uh and Aaron Imean the manner in which theypushed that moment to happen happenedthat Moana was like okay clearlyeveryone has come to play and that thatmistake that that Molly pcka made withpriority that that last wave that uhMoana got that would would have beenMolly's if she hadn't paddled for thatwave she was still thinking in the oldmindset perhaps of the earlier roundsbefore we went into priority and it costher but like you said itwas really throughout the entire EV youcould feel that Moana had she had thespirit Moana so stoked you know it canit shows how much that this means to her$100,000 what are you going to spend onI don't know I'm just I'm stoked to getthose waves now think about this whenMoana Jones was was a young girlthere there wasn't a a pipe Master as asa woman to look up to for this nextgeneration of young women to watch herperformance especially local Hawaiiangirls to have that as a as as somethingto look forward to as atotem these are the moments that 10years from now 15 years from now will beable to see the shift that happens fromthis oh on top of it too a native H Kakiperson to to be able to take her placeand like we say time and time again theHaw culture it's a matriarch it's thewomen that lead the charge and it's justcontinues to exemplify with CarissaMoore the new crop of surfers and MoanaJones Wong she's out here uh justdemonstrating exemplifying our cultureand our heritage what a well-deservedwin congratulations Wana it's so amazingto see you win well during the the thechair up of the queen Eli Olsen decidedto step up to the plate Eli he told meright after we got out of here he said Ijust want some waves I wanted to getnutsI'm ready I want it full on and thisladies and gentlemen is EliOlen Yeah in our interview earlier thismorning he was trying to contain hisenergy he was so fired up look at thathe's he's stoked he said he's got greatboards he feels great his body's healthyand that's just showing when he'spulling into these waves now youknow that thing was a nut strainergetting underneath it look behind thesection you see that look like a backdooring pipeline yeah no and then forfor those who surf out here atpipeline they know sometimes those waveslook like they're breaking as you'retaking off and to have this definitelywas breaking down the line um and tohave that knowledge to know this is agood one I'm going Eli Olsson isdemonstrating his experience as a localhere in the NorthShore moving from 33rdto 13th the single wave 24.8and as we've talked about the excitementof the exciting part about this formatis with 19 minutes to go Eli Olssoncould he could get three of those yeahand suddenly this leaderboard can changeso Billy keer John John Florence MikeyFebruary and Mikey Wright in that onethrough four spot cool telling Jamie I'mgoing backaway ended up not makingthat choice Eli only needs an 18.9 tomove into the finals if things stay atwhere the artnow well he no doubt he's going to bemade aware of that from the beachannouncers and he will be hunting andfocusing as like he told us earlier he'slike I want I want I didn't I didn'tcome here just to perform and have agood time I want to be in thisfinal and no doubt H how could he not beinspired by Moana Jones Wang'sperformanceyeah he's stoked he's hearing his scoreshe's trying to do the math in his headJamie said yeah you got a good score Igot to I got to do some work don't talktome fourHawaiians in in this heat 3 m mcnamerfrom here on the NorthShore Eli as wellJamie O'Brien and corRothman all essentiallyneighbors who are used to sharing thislineup with a whole lot more people on aregular basis Jamie O'Brien of coursebeing the Elder Statesman the one who'spaved the way for what high performancelooks like at pipeline Jamie lookingsuddenly Eli's leading the heat butstill has to compete against the entirefield of competitors to get to that topfour finalsposition and how about uh contestdirectorand Co Rothman turnsslate driving driving through somechandeliers nice one forcor but Nathan Fletcher rolling the dicemaking the call I I was talking to himearlier he's like there were more than afew people this morning when it wasliterally two feet out here who were inmy in my ear with their feet feelingsletting me know that they didn't want togo today and uh he said sometimes youjust got to bank on the experience andwhat you knowand looking at the charts and he saidwe're going I'm going to live on thisdecision and he looks like a like a puregenius greatdecision NathanFletcher Legend in his own right here atpipeline riding himselflong boards to shortboards co co has a real good ability tolate drop you know he just trusts hisrails and he just tippy toes down intowhere he wants to go trusts his line andpulls into these barrels and then kindof just hopes the wave does the rest forhim beautiful job negotiating thosesections I mean you just never stopmarveling at what it takes to complete apipeline wave not just making the dropand then line Choice and then everythingthat has to be NE the decisions thatneed to need to be made in the barrelyeah and being able to move up on thethe front of that board to not sit onthe tail to for that stability to youknow to transition from using your finsto your rail engaging the rail I thinkthat's something that is really uniqueabout a great pipeline Rider is theirability to negotiate from uh put on thethe back foot or the front footespecially in these bigbarrels on the pipe on the pipeline sidewould you rather be uh going going fronthand front side or backside thatpipe this is an interesting one becauseitseems there I'm sure you're going to geta mixed bag here I would I would saybackside going left atpipeis more fulfilling in my mind to see uhpound forp pound I think front side itlooks reallybeautiful um technically though I'mbiased I'm I'm natural stand so I reallylike to see backside uh backside barrelsyou know letting go of that that Railand Standing Tall in those thosebeautiful things towatch listen I'm goofy footed and Iwould agree that there's the Stak seemto be a lot higher and the techniquenecessary I iip you know you watch JohnJohnKelly um it's it lookscool yeah I it's uh by the way I justgot kicked out of the goofy footedfraternity roking my membership rightnow I just seenuh pcha light she posted something onthe social media about uh Craig Andersonon a bus in Ecuador and he was uhswitched they switched his stand so hewas a regular foot and I was looking atI was like I don't know I don't evenknow if he look he as good if you'regoing regular I think just goofy Footershave that natural ability to style out Imean listen don't get me wrong I thinkthat we are superior overall just inlife uh but I am also a fan of of whatregular Footers can do in heavy leftandbarrels oh yeah I mean but still but Ithen but then I look I look at someonelike Gabriel Medina at pipeline who hasthis ability to make it look that muchmore critical in his positioning to youknow what I mean do some really reallyequally nuts things in his approach thatmake it look just as critical well Benjibran you look at Benji he the thingsthat he on his front hand it it looks hehas a style about him that makes it lookextreme and scary uh and and it's stillappealing yeah we we were talking toBenji bran earlier and I was asking himas this swells coming up you know whatare you thinking about and he's like Iwas thinking 64 but now as it continuesto come up he's like I'm I'm going tohave a 68 on standby just in case hesaid you he said I really don't wantanything bigger than that because hesaid as you saw J quinny's wave like youget in but then you want to have thatability to navigate and negotiategetting up and over those sections he'slike so I don't really like anythingbigger than than a6869 so that I can maneuver andcruise speaking of maneuvering andcruising I believe that we're going tohavea a guest on the headset shortlysomeone who's been maneuvering andcruising uh won't tell you who just yetwe have you on standby seems like a stabhole of 7,000 Surfers uh agree and 64%would be drawn to watching someone pullin at pipeline as a natural footer nowwere were was that the was was that likesubscribers or everyone who goes subabthat probably was people who want a freesurfboard wet suit wax or a subscription64% makes sense so regular Footers whatI see 64% of regular foot Surfers wantfreestuff well let's uh check in uh withsomeone who right now is uh safe safe atthe moment knew what he needed to dotoday uh to move up the leaderboardBilly keer joins us on the VF P guestset guest headset sitting comfortably uhin first place for the final as thisswell continues to rise hey Billy what'sup my man how are you I'm well brotherI'm well how's the food how how how youdigesting we had Tomahawk Stakes lastnight that Billy put in the he Billy putthem in the Trager and then shifted themto the grill um yeah I'm still smilingfrom dinner last night yeah we we got toeat like k so we're ready for days likethis well clearly you were fueled whatwas your mindset coming in down thebeach this morning especially I'm surewhen you woke up you saw how small itwas I did see how small it was but Itouched on it last night before he leftmy house just with the buoy readings andjust talking to Marty and making surethat you know we started with thewomen's to be able to give the men someof this SW and I mean once I got here Icould tell every set was a foot biggerand bigger and I told you a few days agofor me it's it's just going Wave by waveright now step by step I'm not lookingat tomorrow I'm not looking about nextweek next month I'm just literally onefoot forward next foot forward and uhsame thing with the waves I'm not tryingto mind surf five waves I'm justvisualizing one wave at a time and justreally trusting my instincts you knowI've been doing this my entire life andI just want to give a shout out to Mattand Sheree Chan and mentally aside fromphysically helping me they've beenhelping me a lot with the mental side ofthings and just really prepping my mymind for days like this and justtrusting you know like I've done this myentire life and you know with yeah withthe broken foot I haven't done that butuh just knowing that this is normal forme I'm more normal out there than I amhere right here on on land you know Ifeel more comfortable on a wave in thebarrel pipeline than I do walking in thestreets and um that's something thatyears of just you know learning askingquestions getting hurt uh falling youknow it takes so much time and andpatience and I'm just happy to be in inthis situation I got my little my kidsright here he's running away from me Lonboy this guy gives me all the courage inthe world he uh he taught me how tofight in life this guy was born earlyand um he fought for his own life andhe's my you know when I Let It Roar it'sall because of him and um yeah I'm justI'm in such a good place I got kalawGrace my my brother my partner um mywife's here my kids Hayes I'm justenjoying it now this is this is a dreamcome true this a pipe Masters that's whymy son skiing school todaywow BR Billy it seems that no prioritycan be difficult for some people and andnot not a big deal for others could youexplain some of that I mean Cliff youknow we grew up here this is the this isthe most powerful place in the worldwhen it comes to surfing there's nothinglike this right here in front of us andthere is never priority out here there'srespect there's uh you know there's atotem pole of of respect of growing upand putting in your time and and gettingyour w and just really learning and uh Igrew up under the the greatest of alltimes you know I was standing right herein these yards watching Andy and Brucewin I watched Derek Ho like Johnny BoyKima Henry my brother Eric like Iliterally grew up idolizing some of themost iconic Surfers in the world andthey're all from here and it just camewith a lot of respect and I feel likeI've I've earned my stripes out here andI put in my time and when it comes to anevent like this without priority thereis a little sense of um kind of a freesurf Vibe but at the same time it's likeI'm not going to sit there and letpeople paddle around me and just takewaves I I I truly want to win like Ithat I I told myself three days beforethis event I went and caught two wavesand I said okay I I physically andmentally believe that I can win thisevent so I'm going to compete and thatwas kind of the that was the the switchfor me of I'm going to do this event andum that's where my mind's at I know I'mgoing Wave by wave and just kind oftaking it easy and being picky but truthtruthfully like I I'm in this to win andI'll do anything in the will of my powerto win um whether it's two foot waves or80 foot waves winning is winning to meand there's always a way to do it youjust got to work hard and and visualizeand believe in yourself and I got a lotof belief and a lot of good energy withmy family and friends behind me sohonestly I I I I don't I don't seeanything right now besides pipeline inmyself that said Billy um we've seenscores going up and up today obviouslyas uh the stakes have gotten higher withthis bigger swell you're sitting on a58.6 right now do you think that will beenough um with these Heats ahead to tohave you in the final when this round isover you know it's hard being in heatone um in this situation because it'skind of like a waiting game and you'rehonestly leaving it in other Surfershands which uh I personally I'm I Idon't like that I want I want to be Iwant to have control I want to have theopportunity but I told myself being inheat one you know knowing that I do havea broken foot this is it like I got to Igot to pull the trigger and I got tomake sure that no opportunity willpresent itself without me conquering andovercoming and uh I feel like I did thatwith every kind of every opportunitythat that showed up in the heat um I didwhat I could I I haven't fallen in thisevent I feel you know pretty damn goodfor where my situation is at and umI'm not counting myself in I'm notcounting myself out I'm just here andI'm ready to roll like if if I'm in thatfinal I'm I'm going to show up to winand uh

but we're looking at theconditions uh we're going to see someHeats that are going to be incredibleand there's going to be some Heats thatI think are going to be a bit lacking inwave opportunity you see here into theHorizon there's not much not much goingon or can't really see too much out onthe horizons which is nice about thiscoastline is there's these outer reefsthat exist that they're kind ofindicator reefs looking to the north youhave these reefs outside of PUK and youyou know straight out you have the thirdreef outside of ehukai and you also havesome other reefs more down towards logsand rock pile that you can kind of startto gauge what's coming what happeningbut when it's underneath the size ofswell that it can actually break onthose autter reefs you're now justwaiting for them to pop up like some ofthe competitors or something well forthose of you uh who have not been withus for the entire three days and youjust tuned in and you're like what'sgoing on here leaderboards Etc uh afterthis wave here by NoahBashan grabbing and dancing through thislittle pipe wave is he going to find anair section he's going to have to tobring the score up on this I thinkI don't know if

explain to us what that was likeout there on a a rising swell flat tobombs what was that like it was it wasso sick to get out there I mean everytime you surf out pipe I mean I haven'thad it happen a lot when you you're outthere alone like I've I've done thisevent at pipe and then uh last yearsurfing out here but every time you'reout in that lineup and you have it toyourself it's just it is just magicaland scary and you're you just have totrust your trust yourself and know whatyou're doing and like we've seen todaywhoever's you know knows this lineup thebest is getting these incredible wavesas we see Mason ho having look here butuh it was you know epic me uh Frankiehar and and Coco ho we really close andwe tried to get in the same heat and wewe nailed it and um yeah it was justlike really fun to be out there and justlike call each other into waves and Iwas pretty far down the leaderboard andand when Frankie got her her wave I waskind of like you know wanted to get heranother wave to try to push her up theleader board so we were we were beingnice at their ladies rules andunfortunately e got injured and uh thatwas just it's super scary so all prayersto e she's an incredible young youngSurfer and up and coming charger so justreally hopeing she's going to be okayand update on Eva Wong um she had a headinjury um from going over the fall shewas attended to by our medical staffhere at the beach and after evaluationthey said you know what let's send youoff to hospital to get some furtherevaluation she will be okay um hopefullywe'll be able to update you uh on hercondition but as we said we wish youngewang uh the absolute best and that isthose are the stakes uh at pipeline it'sit's all fun and games but as we've beentalking about What Lies Beneath thesurface here um makes every wave riddenyou got to be you you got to be makingthe best choices that you can oh andjust watching that girls final like I'vejust been so inspired by the up andccoming the next gen coming out todayobviously Carissa who's you know alsoQueen in her own right out therecharging but you know Moana eron Sierraand Molly um just incredible watchingwhat they can do and how they can surfout there and and that has come with alot of time spent out surfing pipe andand that's I think what has inspired meI think you know these girls have beensurfing at since they were 14 and itshows they they know the lineup and theyknow what they're doing out there andit's just really cool to watch and uhyeah they're amazing you were a partof a movement with with Koko and yourpeers that really set so much forward inmotion now you look at this nextGeneration especially what's happeningfor high performance what does thismoment mean here at pipe for this nextgeneration of of of young women comingup what does this mean for the sport ofwomen surfing oh it's just justunbelievable these girls yeah justbreaking down barriers and uh yeahmaking us all believe that we can do itand yeah know with the hard work timededication like every morning I sawCarissa out there still going for a freesurf she's been competing for so manyyears and she still is out there everymorning at the Cracker Dawn putting inthe time uh and yeah it's just likeincredible to see that work ethic fromher but uh you know her she's P she'spaved the way uh them to see Moana dowhat she's done I think she's inspiredso many and made us believe that yeahlike you can be small and petite and andlike just still send it out pipe it'slike really really cool yeah you whenyou actually see Moana in real lifeyou're just like Oh I thought you werelike 7 feet tall totally yeah I mean Iwas like are you she's getting smallerlike she's just she's a little pocketrocket it's amazing and that Mollypicklum is going to be yeah it's it'snuts I'm so proud of them it's just it'sjust thebest 1959 here togo and uh Direction wise as this swellhas continue to build what are we seeingas some of these waves are sort ofpassingby you can kind of even see some ofthese SWS kind of cross cutting as thestrong wind swell is going to also becoming in there's like a Northeast windswell so you're starting to see some ofthese swells kind of dislodged it's nothaving that nice long West break you'regetting somedisconnection uh and then you have toalways think about what number set isthere too much water that goes onto thereef is the first one the best is it thesecond one you know sometimes there'sfive wave sets we've seen in a heatwhere is the last one the best or is itjust too bath tubed out what was it likeLaura when you're out there when you youseen how throughout your heat it seemedto change even yeah it's been changingall day you know this is an incomingswell so we knew that they you know we'dbe out there and and you know there'd bethose double ups that would come youknow the medium ones and then all of asudden we need to be you know just awareof our situation there could be anabsolute bomb coming from uh the boilout there so just trying to be aware andjust be ready for anything really do youremember your first pipeline session andand who who did you surf with I thinkfirst pipeline session I I feel like Iwould have been around 16 or somethingand I just uh you know was out theresort of watching on the side and justlike making my way up and then I kind oflike got a bit intimidated by the crowdand moved over off the wall and spentlike the last like five seasons surfingoff the wall and I think that's like bitme in the ass cuz now I go out pipe andI'm like I don't know what I'm doinglike where is the wave like and I needto put in the time there I think that'swhat I've I've realized it's like theonly way you get to know this wave is bybeing out there watching the best of thebest do it where they're going to wherethey're taking off um yeah where they'relining up and yeah how they're justabsolutely sending it where doespipeline's power fit in terms of youryour globaluh travels cuz you you've been to yourGlobal sandfest yeah I mean you've beento the biggest and the the gnarliestwaves on the planet where does pipelinerank in that for you oh I mean pipelinejust comes with its whole other fear Imean I think the the fact that you knowthis is one of the most dangerous wavesin the world you see the most injuriesgo down here you see the most headknocks every year that I've been here Ifeel like you're watching someone getinjured and and get sent away in theambulance and it's so scary and it'sjust you have to be so brave andcourageous out there and also smart Noahoh yeah and you're seeing people who gethurt it's not just like Cooks yeah soit's the of your mind and you have toactually work out how to block that outand when you go like totally commit andhave no second guessing otherwise if youif you second guess yourself it's uhthat's when it can becomedangerous it's also having that uhunderstanding to know this is not a goodone like kind of a discipline like youyou can get into a bad situationrelatively easy out there uh you mightnot be able to get out totally but yeahI think uh yeah it's just it's got thiswhole other these whole other teeth toit and there's so many different facesof pipeline I mean it's just it's suchan incredible wave um but yeah justHawaii in general like I just I've beendrawn here every year since I was 12years old to come and surf these wavesand to be able to go and surf pipelinesurf sunset surf outer reefs like allwithin the space of a week and then surfa sandbar that's twoot and fun like youcould literally bring every single boardto Hawaii and like go out yeah ride themmall and just that's what I've alwaysloved about it I also love that it'swarm I hate the cold and it's justliterally bloody Paradisehere well if that's not a a you couldalso go boo or Boo the uh the shorebreak or just like send it over the PoesI body surfing you just did a Hawaiiantourism promo they're going to send acheck we had you miked up a lot uhduring uh the last

the mic up and youyou basically are like the the bestcheerleader that anybody could ask to bein the heat with I'm probably the worstcompetitor ever I literally am just likeyeah Frankie you're ahead of me on theleaderboard go like let's get you in thefinal I need three waves I'm like downin 100 soyeah where did would you say you gotflogged uh heavier out at your your youryour record winning wave at Himalayas orat pipeline I think uh Himalayas forsure but I just there so much adrenalinegoing through your body when you're outat those waves that it actually turnsyou into like some sort of like weirdsuperum that doesn't feel anything likewhen I was at jaws surfing the firsttime I my I got my my knee blown topieces and took like 15 minutes for meto realize that it was like I knew ithurt at the start but then it kind ofwent away and then the adrenaline kickedin and then when it wore off I was likeoh my God my knee's like actually likedone yeah I'm out for 6 monthsyes as you can see uh we've seen in thisheat crossed up swells wind now it lookslike some weird Lake Placid uhwe'll we'll take a second to check inwith our contest director NathanFletcher who was with an actual livinglegend Mr RoyRussell all right we're here with aspecial guest one of my favorite HeroesRory the dog Russell and so we justcrowned a pipe master and just for uhthe sake of pipeline we have a two-timepipe Master we want to ask him what whatit's like to be a two-time pipe Masterwell to tell you the truth Nathannothing really changes me that much butit is quite an you know anaccomplishment and looking back at allthe years man it makes me proud to havebeen part of the whole deal it's a veryvery important contest I thinkit it explains surfing to the very coreBonsai pipeline mangnarly and so what do you think of whatthe kids are doing doing out here thesedays compared to what the guys weredoing in your day what's the differencein that well the the size of thesurfboard mostly the surfboards are somuch smaller now and the guys are takingoff so late before it was like we wereriding aircraft carriers you know we getinto the way real easy which was greatbut these guys nowadays are just pushingthe limits man these takeoffs they'remaking it just under tiptoes I mean it'sjust incredible what they've beenpulling into especially today the sechgetting really really T and uh they'repulling off some really amazing ridesout here Eli I mean Emi and everybodyelse man topnotch really proud of thesekids they're really defining the Bonsaiin Bonsai pipeline totally Mr EO and hisBonsai ride was incredible man that wasall time heads up is is there any adviceyou want to give to the up and comingingkids pick the right wave man it's all onpicking the right wave very importantfor you to sit there and study the surfbefore you battle out I'd spend hoursbefore i' battle out looking at the surfwaiting for the right time it's a 45minute on 45 minute off type deal outhere they were mentioning that the otherday kale and who she was talking toabout each every other heat is is notenough again there weren't enough ways atotally different uh type of swell Imean to totally type of different typeof sets coming in so basically a longtime ago Jerry used to stay stay out inthe water for like hours at a time and Ijust go out for an hour catch my wavesand come in and I told him one time Isaid it's a 45 minute deal 45 minutes on45 minutes off so if you get in one ofthose Heats where it's sudden the 45minutes off you know more power to youyou know but basically pipeline isn'tgood all day long it's a it's it's avery fickle lady and she has theirmoments and it's like basically as faras timing it's a 45 minute dealall right well thank you Rory we reallyappreciate you coming down pick theright wave you're in and I reallyappreciate you inviting me down been 60years standing right here looking atthese waves prettydeat all right thank you all rightyou're welcome folks thank you Nathanand thank you that that was the legendtwo-time pipe Master Roy Russell puttingyou on game what a lord I mean how howhow about all those gem nugget he's likehey oh my gosh I should I should havegot him to coach me he's like on whatplanet do you think this wave just staysthe same allday and right now you could argue thatwe're kind of in a 45 minutesoff Mason trying to turn that around ohjust love watching May surf he alwaysrides like a lot bigger boards and heget so small towards that Center thatsweet spot on the board after he makesthe drop he just moves up and justvirtual nose ride yeahoh look at the air vacuum his hair waslike sucking backwards how he gets up onthe front of thatthing there is there is a world where hemight have made it up over thatbump yeah I'm I'm sure he has a a storyof why it didn't work out the way it didbut what a what a shot that is thoughyou see his hair like vacuuming sufferback he's literally blow dryeryeah what's great about Mason's storiesis 3 seconds he could talk for 30minutes about how fromevery I heard he was classic in thebooth the other day when coko and I weresurfing so good all right with eightminutes to go if I'm Michael FebruaryI'm like really is this what's happeningbecause yes he's in that third spot butwith the heat stillleft there's not safety for for for heor Mikey Wright um and you know he justwants to like put a little something onit I'm a bit blind what does it say heneeds tobetter 14 well he doesn't need to betterhe's in third but but he wants to likehe would like to put a little sauce onit maybe replace that15 that he has with a 20 he's also got aa 14 point something you know he's gotthat nice high score of a 24um but it would I'm I'm super biased butI want Mike febuary in the in in thefinal really bad as does all of SouthAfrica yeah there we go it'd be he'd belooking to drop that 14 it's any anypoint he can get over that is just goingto help his causereally he has thisSW usto turn on and turn off it's a it's ahard one you know being Mikey out thereright now being like do I just look fora midsize wave to try better that or doI just sit and try to wait for another25 it's like strategy therethat and for Noah he's just prob youknow he doesn't need that mucheither to to get in as he's sitting inthat seventh spot yeah just wanting theocean tocooperatean absolute beautifulTuesday here on the NorthShore Laurathank you for coming by and spendingtime enjoy the rest of your season welldo your your your long season I know somuch exciting waves and swells to comeright on and we will be back here withthis hopefully fingers cross excitingfinish to this round three Heat as weMarch towards crowning a men's Championhere at the Vans pipeMasters where are you sitting for yourideal wave at pipe I'll be sitting rightunder Moana no I'm just kidding that' bescary as hell that pop it's like inZoolander when he's like how are wesupposed to Surf pipe like this I'msitting like here right here and I'mgoing to end up rightthere that's the plan back door the peakand get a nice vision and then get spitout oh I don't want to be like here Iwouldn't want to be herehere back at it take a look at itbreathe it in look at that pet ofcolors palm frons and clouds and bluesky and sand and ocean can you feel theenergy the magic energy of the one andonly pipeline here on the NorthShore ofaahu as uh we are in the deep end ofthis heat 4 in round three as RoyRussell said hey 45 minutes on 45minutes off these uh competitors havedefinitely been challenged in what feelslike what's been been an off as far aswhat's been on offer they're probablytripping they're like whoa the women'swere was firing and the last Heat wasalso firingyeah just waiting they're you knowthey're just looking for those lumps topop out behindthem 4 minutes plenty of time for atleast aset set and ahalf but but I couldn't imagine all theadrenaline of after what you've watchedtoday and the performances that you'veseen and the waves that they've beenmind suring and then getting out here inthe ocean just being likehm yeah you see those ribs from the Eastkind of pushing down the coast what doesthat do uh I think it just kind ofdisrupts your takeoff you you have aline you want it all nice and smooth ifnow you have something kind of coming upthe face that is going to inhibit youfrom getting that like maximum power todrop into the wave even a small littleRipple sometimes that your nose couldjust bury into the water to pull youback like that could be the differencebetween getting a nice entry intoholding you up just a tad being too deepor not even making it to your feet youcan really see it from this angle thatwhite water capping from the side Shoreand this is kind of what the theprevailing winds are expected to be overthe the next week stronger from thisdirection so we're kind of in the thewindow right now that it's manageablewith swell uh which is why I thinkNathan opted to want to hold ittoday well will somebody be able to makeamove see knowah having a looktherehere we go something's happening we gotMasonscratching getting pumped oh he didn'twantit will one of thesewaves offer a cleanly opportunity thatcould provide somedifference in our lineup Mason on theboil still a bit too deep see now thesemore Northerly Direction sets arebreaking a little bit off of The Reeffrom the the spots that I'msure those nice West swells coming inthey're they're moving more Norththey're not quite on those the typicalWest swell spots it's shifting it seemslike throughout the day yeah we've seenin the last couple of hours there weresome of those those those more keennorthwesterly ones and then just pureNorths kind of bouncing back andforthyeah again when we look at theseforecasting the buoys may say Northwest6 feet 16 seconds but that's an averagethere's still going to be things thatare a little shorter period longerperiod from a different angle uh so it'salso uh what some people like to doincluding myself is to look at the rawdata not just look at averages go in andopen up and just look at all the numbersand see what the things are are lookinglikebecause an average can skew which isanother reason why it's so great aboutthis competition it's uh cumulativethere's noaveraging that my friends is what youcall science dater welcome to thedater 43 seconds to go wow we we arefrustrated for these athletes um becausewe just want to keep on losing our mindsyeah all day I mean the performancesthat we've gotten to see all day long inwhat have been pretty incredibleconditions uh but for Michael Februarynoan Mason ho and Matashery trulychallenging truly challenging 28 minutesthat has flownby and there will be no[Music]change and like Rory said45 on 45

again but it's not thatoftenyeah all righty beautiful thanks a havea good rest of your day thank you verymuch and in the studio here I have withme the one and only contest directorpipeline extraordinaire one of my bestfriends Mr Nathan Fletcher how are youdoing sir I'm good uh I just came in Iwas told to come in to explain thebackstory on Harry's board okay let'shear it and the backstory is is uh Harrywas taking me through South Australiaand uh our car we broke down ourradiator was bad so we uh pulled intothis town pinong where they have one gasstation then across the street is thehotel slpb that we were stuck at for 3days and so we were uh at the hotel Puband then we come to find out there'sthis shaper Paul grel who his shapingroom was right next door to the pub andI think the town consists of maybe twoor 300 people and so we're at the puband this guy comes in and Harry'stalking to him next thing you know wewalk out of the pub and we go to thisguy's shaping room next door and thenHarry bought one of his used boards andhe gave us The Rundown and I think he'sbeen doing hand shapes for about 50years and since then Harry's built arelationship with this guy and then uhhe's gotten custom boards and it lookslike it really paid off well for him andsay and uh it's kind of a real you knowunknown shaper but it looks to be whatHarry needs you know magic feather itlooked like it worked very well on thatwave there 30 points nonetheless aperfect score score I mean it looks likehe's found those magic carpets downsouth now now Harry only needs a 12.6 toget back up to the fourth spot so verydoable but on another note as well onhis board it looked like a little bitmore board really worked for him you seehim he didn't Bobble or uh it wasn't aproblem getting into the biggest wave ofthe day or the biggest barrel of the dayum it really worked in his Advantagewhere you see a lot of guys riding inthe 66 68 range and that once you hitthat foam right there with a smallerboard your history that big board kindof carries you through all that chatterand if you look I believe it's apolished gloss coat glass on finstotally you know '90s kind of era boardbut it really worked in that situationand so it might even go back to wherepeople are riding a little bit biggerboards on the bigger days instead ofalways just trying to ride at leastamount of board as possible I know uhMason ho will opt for a big board ohthat's experience that's secondgeneration knowledge right there youknow so he's no stranger to surfing biggnarly pipe and neither is his dad andso I know that they talk about it athome and go over it and uh colaniChapman's another guy that rides abigger board out there and get someridiculous barrels yeah especially whenit's windy like this you got to catchthe wave you got to be in down the faceyou don't want to be pulling around atthe top you don't want to be doing nobackslide boogies I seen uh what's hisname Michael febrary get a wave and ifhis board would have held he would havegot a awesome score but it Sid slippedit looked a little small and uhunfortunately wasn't able to engage thefins and ride out of that one so thesebigger boards even Moana if you look ather boards you can tell it was a littlebit longer and it was it was carryingher through those barrels that's anotherthing that I saw too a lot with thegirls um you know it seemed like theswell was rising and it seemed likethey're all on pretty small boards andyou saw the difference with Moana whereyou want to ride the wave you want tocatch it and ride it and kick out and uhit's really hard when you're trying toride the most uh high performance andreally defined shape all that stuff kindof goes out the window when the wind andthe wave and everything's just jackingand you can't see you're paddling in anduh it really looked to be in Harry'sadvantage to be on the equipment that hewas on well I bet some of the girls inthat in some of those Heats you knowwatching the waves all day cuz it reallyjumped up in a couple of those women'sHeats you know a couple aoup a couplefeet like it this swell really startedto fill in so it probably caught acouple of them off guard you know 100%when it's coming up the waves are movingmuch faster than on the resding side ofthe swell so you just want to catch itand Wrangle that thing and go you don'twant to be uh Dilly dallying around atthe top but you know what maybe backsideit is easier to get away with a smallerboard because you're grabbing your Railand you're driving but I feel like frontside you really need the right equipmentwell thank you so much Nate for joiningus in the studio here as you can see ourbeautiful uh broadcast Bo excellent calltoday oh thank you yes there wasdefinitely speculation but the call wasmade couldn't have made a better call itis what it could asked for a better dayfor the pipe Masters and especially forthe women I thought that uh moana'sperformance today was a second to andreally made history for women surfingyeah well thank you very much NathanFletcher and don't go away we will seeyou right back here at the Vans pipeMasters 2023 from the beautifulNorthshore of Oahu inhavai here we have the trhy um fromlashi I feel like trophies on everythingbut there's certain trophies that ignitethe the memory of like certain storiesand it's my proudest one I think becauseit was like the most time that Iprobably spent trying at one specificlocation I feel pretty honored to havewon that event because they invited allthe women that are potentially the bestat part so it was definitely one to winwinning it again it's a massive ask butI did it once so why not again and umyeah I just think it'd be crazy that'sdefinitely something I want to dobecause I don't know I

which would be a 43 32 3 and23.1 that woulduh really do it for him no he' need afour point something 4.24.2 what would do it anduh seeing how he's been surfing if he beif he'spatient that 4.2 should be no problem toso equal12.4 and it's crazy he's got 12.80 12.10so he has a score up there that couldhave been used 310 of apoint not enough and uh paddling forthat wave we had one of our Surfers inblue if I'm not mistaken Aon Osborne wasgoing for thatleft here we go Harry Bryant broughtHarry looking for that score from behindhe's in he's up and he is going on astraight hander that is not going to getthe score he is looking for that is notthe one and uh still 11 minutes 20seconds remaining now 11 minutes and 20seconds remaining time to get back outthere and get thatscore what what heats after this one isthis the uh the flooring seat coming upI thinkwe get the honor of calling the FlorenceBrothersluau as they're about to hit the lineupand feast the band of beards is going tobring it that unruly pipeline little bitnorth little bit north winds little bitsand on the reef there's not exactlyperfect conditions by any means but thewaves arefiring lots of scoring potential onhand Kell what do you see in this thislast Heat how it just absolutely turnedon and shuffled the leaderboard aroundthat was C like the first five minuteswas just crazy like hugescores the leaderboard was just jumpingall over the place guys were in guyswere out I mean soexciting yeah it's definitelya a spectacle when the waves go off outhere and they start firing as we wouldsaywhen all Surfers have the opportunity tocatch big waves big barrels and get bigscores that's what it's all about hereat the Vans pipe Masters2023 and just a little law in the actionpipeline it just woke up CCH catchingits breath from that flurry catching itbreath it's definitelyuh been putting out a lot of energythese last few Heats and it seems likeit turns on and it turns off right nowit's not really at the point where it'sjust kind of firing throughout theday yeah there's some Heats where it's alittle slow and then other Heats whereit's justbanging yeah this seems to be a heatthat was banging and now they areprobably banging on theirboards trying to create some uhvibration in the water to bring thosesetsalongsee everybody some cheers in thebackground on thebeach we got somebody on the insidesomebody taking thisone sharq is up and he is down I am nottoo sure have to see who that Surfer wasonthis lastwave looked to be Sharfall uh look like Nathan Florence is offof the egg shaped funsize board and he'sback on a very seriouslooking none other than John pisel ThreeBrothers will be riding pisel surfboards here's a replay of that last waveK yeah justclamped no noexit on screen MrNathan Florence GoPro in I would say inhand but inmouth anduh hopefully we get some insights fromthat GoPro and hopefully we get someinsight in one of them are mikedup it would be amazing it once againHarry Bryant only needs12.6 7 Minutes Advance into our finalfour spots 7 Minutes 42 secondsremaining can HarryBryantpull the rabbit out of thehat if anybody can brought a Harrycan and uh that'd be wild to have thehighest score of the entire contest butnot make the final but happens like Isaid you could have a 10 still not makeit yeah here we go set mon is right offthe bat I mean this was seconds into theheat righthere look at that so committed so stuckto thewave was perfectpositioning he knew exactly where hewanted and where he wanted tobe but right here BR Bryant let's go braHarryBryant I didn't think he was coming outdidyou never doubt Harry Bryant I meanthese guys so deep these guys come froma place that the waves are absolutelyfiring as well so Barrel riding skills Idon't doubt any of these guys in thisevent that they're not going to makewaves they're all so good and it justtakes that one section to let youthrough yeah but that section where itkind of spit and and the spit came outalmost before him and then there wasanother section then you saw his boardcome after the spit that's what kind ofpushed him out of the barrel was thatspit and that foam was driving forwardinstead of him being on the backside andfalling off it kind of caught under hisboard and kind of was like a little uhlike a little floor escalator you knowin the airport when you're tired youdon't want to walk there's those flatescalator people mover yeah it's like hejumped on one of those and it just kindof right through thebarrel it did look like he had a littlestring har Bryant looking like HarryHoudini yeah it looked like he had alittle string attached to the nose ofhis board just like pulling him along ohyeah there is definitely a string tryingto pull him off his board but he hand onhere he is again I'm not sure what's upwith this wave selection here by HarryBryant brother you need a small wavejust a bar will come out to make it tothe top four let's get back out thereholdposition and choose a wave that's goingto be a score that's going to let youout there's not thatmany got to go out there and search anduh even those inside double UPS I'vebeen seeing are sick and I think thatyou can get a 12 on one of those easy oh4.2 yeah that's uh he'll probably dothat with his eyes closed I I'll beguessing here comes that currentno Porto Escondidois Harry Bryant better paddle cuz thatis not the place you want to be when theset comes in you will get absolutelysmoked you see that wind how it'sstarting to crumble down the end of theWavesyeah yep here comes the north notgetting the easy the Northeast windswith the north more Northerly angledwestwell I would say little West withthat Northern tail on itand it will definitely shut the wavesdown the thing about this Northerlydirection is you don't want to sit toodeep yeah there's no sense sit way backthere unless you can get reallylucky for the most part the waves willbe breaking more towards the middle ofthelineup and uh towards the middle of thepipeline lineup That is not too fartowards off the- wall and not too fartowardshookai kind of just right right in themiddle and uh Derek hole was always goodat finding that uh end middle section asof late and he would just absolutelydominate Derek was out there justgetting insane waves all the way upuntil the end of his life like stilljust charging everysession one of the best out here atpipelineoh yes iing to be doing it at his age atthat high level still at that levelstill it'sinsane here we go 3 minutes and 22seconds will the Cinderella will theCinderella storyunfold for the one Harry Bryant whoneeds just a 12.6 just a 12.6 and itlooks like theocean it's not really cooperating butright here if this ishim if this is Harry Bryant he gets tohis feet he's got achance nope sorry buddy damn that's gotto be so frust year that's got to be sofrustrating he's had three like thatthey just did not offer up the scoringpotential like I said some people willhaveperfect scores and still don't make itto a final or make it out of theheat well however it shakes out he'sgoing to feel like a winner todaygetting the highest score of the contesta perfect 30-point ride I mean that wavewill be all over the Internet and goingviral really shortly here and um youknow he'll still get the notorietyhe'll be knownto have the best wave of the eventregardless of making the finals or not Yand uh yeah I think that's the beauty ofthis event right now especially withthis format 2 minutes left Harry BryantImean he could get one come to him anduh make it all happen you know sky isthe limit right now this next wave lookslike a pretty sick one the shape on itis like uh it's definitely going toBarrel but ashare uhheld offHarry I bet Harry I bet Harry was likego please don't get it please oh my goshplease let me havethis and oh my gosh what was that lookslike a it's getting a little bumpy WithThe Wind that looks like the board wentbackwards and it was not the right boardfor pipeline maybe for airs but not forhere and uh that's what happens when youhave the wrongequipment it ends up going the wrongdirection one minuteremainingHarry brought aHarry look there's Harry on the insideright there har like looking over hisshoulder like please don't get it pleaselet me go and Sharie is like 6'8 and hejust was like I'm catching that forsure let's see what happened herenothing pulled out Harry would have beenin that thing right there gettingdrained that would have been his 12point oh my that would have been his12.6 and the worst thing is shareifnever even had a chance to make it tothe finals but you can't give anythingto anybody in these events this is acompetition anduh well looks like our Harry Bryant willbe going home ladies and gentlemenwow just goes to show you what one waveis does not do the trick here you needat least two waves and some backupscores what a heatthough Harry's got to be stokedanyways wave of a

too short of pants takeit out oh we got some we got some TanLines there we go NastyNate oh that was a nasty wave that wasan absolute smoker technical drop and hesomehow got out the back there theseFlorence Brothers never seem to amaze meby what they can pull off and Emil isjusthe thought he was that chopes rightthere taking off under thelip but I think that was a MOA leashonly the leash got barreled on that[Laughter]one well the waves are picked up thewind is picked up a little bit ohoh coming in little uncharacteristic ofthese Florence boys coming in hot flyingthrough the air it almost I wish JohnJohn was miked up he probably wasselling those waves to his brothers likeyeah go go go yeah this a good one nowJohn's in pull position I want to seehow this is going to play out if areally good set comes are they justgoing to let JN John do JN John andabsolutely smoke most people like he'sdone for so manyyears Mr John Florence out there in theblack we have another replay of Nate'snasty wave that thing is bottomed outright there he was not making out ofthat it sucked back too much foam I meanlook at that just barely makes a droppulls up and right there that white washjust says see you laterRaider and Nate is down and with the Moaleash you see his leash getting barreledthere and then uh our sideview that was a steep vertical drop wowlook at that pounding guys from thepoint to the channel Thatwave anduh I know maybe these guys have acompetition of who can get the most HangTime on the drop you neverknow LOL in the action again LW in theaction again there's no lws in the boothwe want to introduceone of the North Shore's uhfinest and uh a boy that I watched growup watch his father absolutelyrip the entire world topieces and uh I want to Welcome to thebooth Mr Noah Bashan what's up guyshow's it going what's going on we'rewe're wondering the same thing what'sgoing on out there buddy how was thewaves uh I meanmy heat didn't have much waves just nowso you know it's it's the ocean someHeats are firing some Heatsaren't um I feel like I was kind of Ithought I was blowing in my heat becauseI didn't get anyways but then I came inand a lot of my friends were goingthere wasn't there weren't really thatmany waves in your heat so there werthat many waves your heat and literallyas soon as the horn blew it was just BamBam Bam guess what if you guys wouldhave had that extra 2 minutes you hadthe otherday I know that would have changedeverything the difference two minutescan make out here at Pipeline and we'retalking to Noah Bashan one of the bestto do it out here Noah um looking at theleaderboard here who do you think hasthe best chance of of shaking up thisleaderboard knowing that we only havemaybe four more Heats to go um Imean I think anyone can really it's justif if they're in the right place at theright time you know it's like right nowit's kind of all over the place so Ithink all these guys are capable ofmaking these waves is Baron coming up inthe heat soon yeah Baron and matah so wegot Nathan right here pingFlorence talk to us about the little bitof a North crumel it has on the wavepeople are kind of wondering why youknow it looks so perfect coming in nicebig set and then it just kind of closesout what is that it's just the northwind you know North Wind kind of cominga little on Shore and crumblingcrumbling the barrel making it not asnot as pretty and nice as as you'd wantit but how much more difficult is it torideal wave that has those chandeliersand those crumbles in it it's it's a lotmore difficult if you have to bepunching through white waterer sectionsI mean you you guys know that but I meanif the wave's hollow enough then youshould be able to get through that andopen up a little bit give you a littlebit of room sometimes you hit achandelier think you're coming throughand it's like a brick wall and you'relike where did that brick wall come fromin the ocean and little do you know ifyou're moving fast enough the ocean canturn into pretty much concrete and thesewaves are stop you right in your tracksthis wave will stop you in your tracksforever if you're not careful and uhyeah Noah Bashan got a sick wave talk tous about that back door wave uh we hadwho was in the booth with us somebodywas in here and was like I could havewent right on that one but it didn't gowho else was in your heat with you oh itwas it was Mason it was was in the Heatand he was like I was looking and Iwasn't I was going to go and oh my Godthat's what that wave turned into he wasbaffled when he watched it yeah yeahthere all deeper than me and I waspretty wide and then I just got a chipinto it and I had like a little split ohIvan it just got way too casual on thatone did he get a brick wall I like Ibarely caught the end of it but that waslike a bat to the Head morelike it did look like somebody that waslike a false crack in school you'rewalking not looking and then not comesout of nowhere Nate's Nate's wave alittle earlier that he didn't make lookpretty crazy too his drop yeah that wasa super let's see what up in here walkus through this no um he's justcruising and then just pipe it just didsomething weird it's like that song whatisit yourhead got he stood Too Tall he stood TooTall too casual and took a lip to theHead well pipeline moves a lot peopledon't know that this wave breathes so itlooks big then it gets almondy and itgets small and it'll breathe you backand'll open up and spit you out over aledge and uh that's the kind of way I'dwatch the replay myself and justgo damn it if if anybody can tell ourwater camera out there to lick his lensof all the water shot so nice and blurrymy wipe out in Tahiti where I ripped myface off was one like that where I justgot a little high wasn't even that bigof a way but just got a little too highin the barrel lip just barely clippedthe head but sent me pile drive it'sfunny when that happens to it's likeIan's so good he probably thought he wasjust going to cruise through that waveand then it just he looked like he wasjust cruising cruising and then it justdid something weird and boom does it notseem like every time you're like justcruising or like you feel like you canjust relax in the bars somehow it Clipsyou in the head you come out feet firsthow many times have you're like you knowwhat I mean you're thinking you'recoming out talking about coming out ofbarrels BR Harry Bryan Holly we want toknow how it feels to be BR Harry Bryantright nowhas man is that the board you got in thepub it's the guy that made me the boardfrom Pub but yeah Paul grael from pongmade me this board and I kind of when Igot this board I kind of felt like I wasgoing to get to wave my life on itsooner or later but didn't think it wasgoing to happen today but yeah thevision from inside that tube was crazyI'm like kind of can't even reallybelieve can't even really believe thatit happened but I'm really really stokedand very thankful to have theopportunity and serve Pipeline withthree other guys out and that wave kindof chose me and I was on the exact rightboardso stoked yeah that extra length waslooking real good paddling into that uhare you offer that you

andright here during theinterview little small barrel for oneNathan Florence looking to uh mayberedeem himself in those last fewwaves anduh kind of side slipped got in thebarrel he's going to be looking for abetter one than that I could tell yourightnowYeah It's Tricky out there he's justtrying to trying to find something yeahtrying to get something going somemomentum huh yeah make one make two andthen the bomb comes or right here Ithink they know John's uh in pullposition outback he's uhwaiting for the one he's looking prettygood with 57 points um I'm sure he'sgoing to want to overtake Billy he'sdefinitely not going to want to uh stayin third because is you know you get upin that top spot there's three PE fourpeople that still got to take you overyou're in third only two people whenyou're in fourth you're really bitingyour nails everyheat once again we are here in studiowith NoahBashan welcome Noah to the studio Noah'sbeen walking us through uh kind of whatit was like out there in this heat whatit was like to ride some of these wavesand um tell us about um is thereanything else you got going on any partsdropping anything interesting that uhhas been happening lately um well meAndy Woodward and um Gabe Caswell wecame out with a movie project that we'vebeen working on for the last like yearand a half so that's on Red Bull TVright now and um we'll put out adirector's cut in in April oh nice yeahso that's pretty much it we did aPremiere here beginning of winter andjust filming and surfing and justfreaking having been fun beautiful welove it but um we're going to watch yourwaves here from earlier on in the eventand maybe have you walk us through a fewof thesewaves um there yougo yeah Imean I mean that back door wave I prettymuch just yeah just took off the onehigh pump you at the end and you justpunched you're like man that was thefirst time I rode that board too and Iwas just like wa this board works sickand then that's yes that's the otherwhen it was smallerripping showing us you can kill it inthe the variety we had on tap for thisevent yeah yeah Frick this day there'scrazy ramps I didn't really get any anyproper sections but cuz I was going on amillion waves like every w i thedifference what's the difference incompeting like the first day 6 to8perfect second day small airs ManeuversThird Day pumping in Wild how is it toadjust your strategy throughout those 3days knowing the um what is needed youknow knowing what the judges are judgingon how do you kind of adjust yourstrategy to that I think for I mean forme specifically and like my friends wegrew up here on the NorthShore you knowlike so for us it's kind of just likeanother day you know like every day isdifferent on the NorthShore one day it'sgood for airs one day it's good forbarrels so you kind of just wake up andsee what what the deal is and and ifit's firing pipe sick and if it's 3otlittle back door with wind to the rightsI'm just as psyched so so yeah sohowever it is it'slike we're we're lucky over here we haveso many different styles of wave so manydifferent styles of Surfing that that wecan do so was pretty cool to see allthose different styles highlighted hereat this event with that kind of smallerdays with a big like you're seeing onyour screen kind of wild unruly biggerpipeline and then uh that perfect firstday but uh yeah we enjoy your surfing weenjoy all your content that you createand you put out Noah you're just aoutstanding guy not just in the waterbut out of the water too real respectfulkid and always you know seem to be doingthe right things here we go I've beenwriting and mail talking about doing theright things that was a wrongthing maketime I appreciate that though M thankyou no it's all you man we're justgiving the credit where the credits doand uh your father and your mom suchawesome family know your brother outthere doing his thing too so aloha tothe Bashan family if you folks arewatching Uncle gav as well in his littletribe but here's John John this is theone he was waiting for this istojn is that his first wave that's hisfirst wave god wow 20 minutes later 19minutes and 40 seconds later John Johncat is his first wave anduh I think it's going to be better than20 points a 15 points he's back he's gota 15 Pointbackup yeah he's definitely at a 19 wowhe's definitely going to lose that 15and replace it with no real real highscores all put together huh this look atthat drop I mean butter Fu I mean thefact that how Wild and and likedifficult it is out there for him tojust catch his just wave is not wholetime and C his first wave and that's itthat smooth look at this look at thewind not a bobble out ofplace nothing 100% control look at himon that foone ball just like it I wouldhave got fcked look at that fooneball he just comes I mean look at thattries that little rotation at the endit's really hard to beat John John outhere especially in a format like thiswhere you carry scores over cuz he'sgoing to get one or two each heat and alot of the times it's just bad luck on abackup score or this or that that youknow John John usually but in a freelook how far forward his foot front footis you have to be you got to be upforward to get that momentum you cannotbe back on your grip right here h noyou're on the back of your board you'lljust Wily right there and then rightthere he's just ha he's laughing rightthere he laughing right there watch thefoone ball starting to come up and underhis board and he he almost like slid alittle bit and then got it back undercontrol that guy's so under control evenwhen it looked like he sliding out orhe's going to do this or that he is sounder control it is insane yeah theboard control that JN John possessesit's it's un like any other yeah sitsituation under control oh yes thesituation is under controlnow I think he will be controlling oursituation if I'm not mistaken ooh barmate but but then you got two guys righthere that don't give up who's in thelead they are out for blood mat J andbaron boymamia two of the standout Premier BarrelRiders of thisgeneration anduh you know it's just if the wave comeslike Harry Bryant said that wave choseme yeah straight up it it did it's it'skind it's kind of how it is where itcomes on the reef where you are on thereef at pipeline you know no 3 feet 2 or3 feet to the wrong side and you're doneyou know 6 in out you're done you're toofar out like you just have to be in thatspot and look at that27.3 he is in first God I can't wait tobe the chosen one yeah I know it's crazyme and mace were tripping because we hadthat whole heat and then we didn'treally get much and then the heat endsand these sets come in and he's Harry'sin the perfect spot and it's just likehe did get he did get chosen he gotstraight Chosen and that wave was andthen he made the wave too though so itwas insane yeah I mean just where hedropped in everything was so smoothabout that wave it didn't really givehim too much of a hard time even in therough spots it kind of carried him rightthrough that barrel and itjust Noah Dean he's looking for I wonderif he drank one of the beers we rightjustnow I was laughing earlier he was onhere he was talking about how does yogaa couple a couple times a week coupletimes amonth it's hard toconcentrate no sick so classic sotalented too was that Craig Andersonwith him tooyep got make time make time just gotthat one closeout he's staying with me rightnow he's a classic kid Meo yeah yeahyeah oh yeah he's so sick and he's thatbuck charges yo charges yeah he'll go onwhatever my goodness I know it's kind ofboming that it's not really translatinginto a score line for him right now buthis charging is just especially inTahiti yeah it's on a whole anotherlevel seesome line stackingup oh John John has jumped firstguys that's rightJohn is now in[Music]first one wave could take any one ofthese competitors right now tofirst I mean 130 or 127 right now I meanyou're back up theleaderboard Mikey February is on thesqueeze Patrol he's infourth are those still his scores fromour firstheat I'm pretty sure there are y it'scrazy it's crazy you can either get itall all in your last secondfirst whatever it's kind of that's whythe format's so cool yeah it's awesomeyou might have one bad heat and so whatyou can still win the contest you knowyeahyeah yeah he's got to be these last fiveminutes are going to be going by reallyslow for Mikey February who is on thebubble in the fourthspot on the Cliff's Edge of qualifyingfor the final ornot Nate Florence up been riding on alittle righthere he's going to want to get one ofthose 27o rides here wasJohn's big score that propelled him intothe lead in the VansJohn JohnJohnthey said he they said he wasn't he wastoo cool for just one name they had toname him twice he is now your top of theleaderboard John JohnFlorence as if we couldn't have bet onthat huh no surprise I wonder what theodds would have been of John John comingout in the lead after the preliminaryrounds if they if they bet on in Vegas Iwonder what what um one and 10 one inone and too I mean I'm sure they'rebedding somewhere right next door[Laughter]too oh John Florence in the lead Billykeer in second setm in third Michaelfebuary in the coveted fourth spot andhow he's been hanging on to that thiswhole time is definitelyuh the question of the day so manytalented Surfers so many opportunitiesbut yet Mother Nature just not lettingthem get that score needed to you knowjump into that four spot and Michaelferary holding on to it respectively sohe was getting drained had a lot ofgreat waves and uh he's deserving thespot that he'sin yeah he's held on to that that topfour since day one which iscrazy I mean look looking at theseconditions right now Noah it's superchallenging with the nwell with Northwinds to get any type of score huh yeahyeah 100% that's why it's like you seeNate there's the strategy where you kindof go around and you just try to catchwaves and hopefully one kind of is goodand then there's John where he just kindof waited to right here Ian I I oh he'sgoing wow make it down that one wasFluffy oh he was almost right there hisboard was shoveling through it maybe Idon't know if it was him or his boardbutI seen his boardcoming that one look Fluffy from thefrom the GetGo from theGetGo that's tricky it could be so badand then a really good wave could comein you know so it's like as long as ithas that double up and that West angleto it the wind's not as bad but whenthey're stretched out and they're alittle more like have a weak shoulder tothem that long weaker shoulder it's kindof it's almost a wrap especially downthere by that sandbar huh yeah let'scheck this out it was already crumblingoxit onno way he there there look oh yeahyou're right yeah look good eyMak I don't know if his board was ghostriding or if he was actually on itfor a little bittraveling yeah I definitely think thisformat though was really cool you knowlike you get to serve three timesguaranteed you know and then they theytake the the best four to the final it'slike everyone gets a pretty pretty goodshot I mean most other sports skateskateboarding snowboarding they'reusually ran like this yeah mhm theyusually ran where everybody surfes andyou know what the fans get to watchtheir favorite Surfer surf multipletimes just because they might have hadone bad heat whatever it may be you getthe engagement of the fans all the wayuntil finals day because you're backwatching your favorite Surfer guaranteedevery day and I really think it gives alot moreexposure time on screen and um I thinkthis is just the way to go honestlywe're here make time maybescratching let's go come on make oh wowoh no that it's not It's Tricky cuz thesandar is pretty close that was like ano that is not what you want todo 30 seconds Corners out he looked likehe was becoming one with the lip rightthereand Florence

oh might have got hurt yeah I saw akid walking up with a broken Board ofhis oh noso he'll get some attention asthe being lookedat we'll update you on hissituation and but how about IvanFlorence and Nathan Florence you knowsuper challengingconditions where they just threwthemselves into as many pits as theycould yeah they sent it that was youdon't really see that from the FlorenceBrothers falling too often I mean wellthe waves I mean weren't giv them NEnecessarily all the opportunities butthen John John's like well look looklook what's out here guysyeah they didn't need the biggest scoresbut again at pipeline in generalsometimes those are the hardest scoresto get it's the men's field is tough thejudging is is noteasy or I would say it's it's not quitepredictable maybe for competitors yeahNathan Florence noticing that uh Mao isbeing tendedto make thatfirst what a day again if you're justjoining us or you've been with us youyou knowpipeline has a billion faces and we haveseen all of them over the course of mostof them over the course of these uh 3days of competition but today has beenuniquely interesting as when we came tothe beach it literally was waste tochest high and this swell just startedbuilding and building and building asyousee perhaps the greatest surfer in theworld right now over all around JohnJohn Florence is now in that number onespotfocused on a pipe MastersChampionship when you see JN John uhagainst and standing next to otherhumans you realize not a small humanno thegrowth I think we all seen remember himfrom the uh thicker than water movieyeah 12 years old six 6 seven years oldwhen we first got to knowhim I remember that Surfer magazine Iremember when he got the cover of Surfermagazine I believe he was around 12years old and back then you know presocial media the cover was the mostcoveted spot photo incentives Etc andthere were a lot of people who werechirping how can a12-year-old get the cover that should beme and you know that that that coversaid hey this this this guy is thefuture it's one thing to have the entiresurf media and the world say hey you'regoing to be the guy another thingentirely to live it and and build theLegacy uh that John John Florence hasand he is with Holly right now stoked inthat number one spot hey John uh firsttime Ser paryeah yeah I can only catch onewave umconditions what do you think it's goingto be like in the final uh I think it'sgoing to be challenging it's it's gottenpretty challenging out there um there'smoments you know like watching HarryBryant W was incredible Seth got the onebefore then Harry got that one and likehad that little 10-minute moment youknow but this wind is uh always makes itreally difficult out here it just kindof has enough onshore to it where itmakes it crumble really hard and sounless you get the really bowly onesthat really open up it's prettydifficult and uh what are you riding andwhat are you going to be riding in thefinal changing up or no keep it at thesame riding 66 uh next up pel um kind ofmy go-to pipe board and uh yeah there'ssome pretty good siiz sets coming rightnow and this there's still a lot ofenergy from this swell filling in umso yeah hope for the best sick all rightthanks AESripping that was John John for I'm goingto destroy the field and win thisthing yeah um a few years back uh afootball player American football playerJimmy Graham asked me if I knew who uhJohnnyJohnny was hey who's that Johnny Johnnyguy in your sport bro Johnny Johnny Iwas out on the trip CR well he wassaying he was hanging out with uh ReefMcIntosh uh and Cole at the pilver housebig football fan Reef pintas remember hehad the the collaboration signatureChargers I mean reef is the size of a afootball player a big easily could havebeen tight end I I had his uh hisQuicksilver Charger shorts back in theday but he uh he said I was hanging outwith my my boy Reef we were watchingthis little boy at the Triple CrownJohnnyJohnny he's probably like 12 I was likewhen was this I guess it was a long timeago I like yeah he's like 30now he's like a multi-world championJohnny Johnny Johnny Johnny yeah thatJohnny Johnny's done good for himselfbro uh special shout out to our onewonderful Partners here uh the Spectrumsurf channel here in Hawaii uh it'salways nice when you're when you're herein the Hawaiian Islands uh when you'rewatching the surf contest you don't gotto go to your laptop just go right toyour TV and Spectrum uh broadcasting itas they would any major league sportsevent so we are grateful for them andeverything they've done uh to spreadthis band's pipe Masters around to theHawaiianIslandsall the Surfers here in this heat needtwo waves to make the final which is whyMikey February was is breathing a slightslight side of relief because FlorenceBrothers just needed one respectivelyIvan andNathan I had also in talking to myFebruary that pipe wave that close outthat he packed he bounced really hard onthe reef showed me he had a littlecontusion scratch there on the hip andhe said oh it's starting tothrob you know that's thedance she can be nasty outhere but they may need two waves butthey are they are all Surfers who arefully capable oh yeah fully fullycapable Baron mamia of course gettingready for his third year on the WSLChampionshiptour his uhperformances not just at pipeline butSunset Aliva like he is uh he's got allof thetools yeah and Craig Anderson againthe man any one of these mateDr they have oh Baron starting thingsoffquick reevaluating that decisionMikey was also describing what you'vebeen pointing out in these ribs that arecoming up the face from that that windis it it's East Wind yeah yeah NortheastNortheast wind it's actually it's comingmore into across the face then offshoreout the back when you got a bit of Northin that easterly trades he wasdescribing just how challenging it istrying to just just to get into waveswhen you've got these big big ribs andthis crazy wind and then on top of itlike negotiating all this stillweirdness from the sand that's left uhin thechannel yeah you can if you look closelyyou can see those so now you can see theintervals you see the water moving inreally short intervals moving from thebottom right of the screen to the topleft those are that's the wind as welland it seems a lot smoother from theDrone but in the water those those aresignificant chops moving up the facethat's the the prevailing trades andthen you have another Northeast kind ofswell crisscrossing alongside that andthen you have the per the the longinterval Northwest well so you havethree sort of swells in the water if youtake a look back and you kind of squinyour eyes you see patterns you see X'smoving across above the reef so but youalso do see that the sand is beingpulled off you we're seeing we don't seethose uh sandcrack or we don't see the cracks filledwith sand as much anymore that has beenmoved off with those sets revealing nowmuch more defined and dangerous pipelinebottom we'll get you an update on emozerx uh condition as he is being tendedto and with 17 seconds to gohereNoah Noah Deanscratching and dodging 17 minutes togo as John John said going to it ischallenging out there I love the factthat he said hey it's super challengingbut when you see Harry'swave you know when you see his wavethere you got to you got to find thoseopportunities as we will take uh a shortbreak and return turn here in heat 7 atthe Vans pipe[Music]Masters I think it would be awesome tobe front side at pipe but also I lovebeing front side at back door it's anadvantage to be a regular foot at pipeline you get to go front side at backdoor and then drag your ass H pipe andbeing compressed it's easier to bebackside on a steep heavy drop becauseyou don't have to get that extensionandoss air drop you can just stay closeand tight on your rail like you seeJamie who's the best ever like hedoesn't leave the face ever but frontside sometimes you're just forced tobecause you have to be like open to thewave welcome back to a magical Tuesday alive shot of the beauty that is pipelinehere at the van pipe Masters we are inheat7 and uh some bombs coming out the backbut as Dr capona pointed out earlierwith all the triangles and movementthat's going on it is unruly and hard topick out the gemsmhm we see there's a bit of uh rollingthe dice today and some people it's beenin their favor others not so much peoplescratching any which ways you got peoplegoing to the Channel people going to thebackdooragain these ribs moving across the faceare making extra difficult andchallenging but still if there was nocontest there would probably be 50people out right now at least 50 50 1002005,000 allhoping see this extra swell right infront of this breaking see that's a thatthat's something that you don't want tosee taking off is an extra lump althoughI've seen Benjibran decide that those are the waves hewants at any given day and somehow getscrazy treats him treats him like adouble up yeah he's just hoping that iteventually connects into one massivewave that he'll somehow find his way tothe endofyou engage in something called Reefmodeling you've talked about before umwhat does that mean and how do you doit so Craig oh stand by Craig fadinggoing in onhis I mean stylish so stylish it makesyou thinklike is he doing anything in realityhe's doing a lot I wonder what he'swriting but that looked really cool youcould see kind of kind of faded thattakeoff a littlebit Yeah I think he's riding uh a Haydenshape looks to be a Thruster more foamup front sort of board would beinteresting to know if he's opted toride a polyurethane board or a expandedpolystyren EPS orpu but yeah uh Reef modeling essentiallyis creating taking a series of imageslet's see Craiglooking really getting into it easy andfinding that line and kind of hoping itstays open which it doesn't but you dosee he did jump again these individualsunderstand hey I I have to get I have topenetrate these waves if I wantto stay safe out there but by taking aseries of photographs uh they can beinserted into a program and then they'reessentially stacked intothreedimensional models and what thebenefit of having threedimensionalmodels of the bottom mapped out overjust say a 2D image is you have extradimensionality to be able to see and gointo the different cracks and structuresof the reef we see here this is a a 3Dmodel of pipeline that crack right thereis the slab section which water movesthrough here causing a wave to reallyheave and throw a really wide Barrel souh again our lab called the mega labtries to find these features on the reefto be able to know where are the mostimportant Reef features that translateto perfect waves one of the things thatwe've seen over over the yearsespecially with with Kell you've heardKelly Slater talk about here and also atcloudbreak is describing them as fingersand knowing which ones to sit ondepending on what the swell is doingbecause of what the wave is going to doin that position yeah you start to seethat that uh traditionally we like tothink of uh Just Energy being tripped bya bottom a reef a rock structure asandbar but we're starting now in themega lab we're starting to uncoverspecific features within the reef thatare specific to certain parts of thewave at pipe you see it kind of cappingand it doesn't really heave until acertain section we have now find certainre features below pipeline that time itjust perfectlywhere you kind of know okay the wavechanges its face once it comes intocontact of a specific re feature andthese Reef features aren't justubiquitous they're not just scatteredwilly-nilly throughout the reef they'reactually put in they they are found incertain areas which make the wave a bitmore predictable um that being said umwhen people triangulate again and findtheir land references it it correlatesreally well like in Kelly slers wavepool they say okay wait for the flagokay now it's going to Barrel you hearrman or Kona saying now this is it asyou can see here this is that back doorsection where it's all flat and you havea big channel here that sets apart ANSand off the- wall and all of thesefeatures and spur and grooves and cracksin the reef have a very specific role increating the waves that we see and we'velearned to surf out at Pipeline and backdoor how does this I mean this isincredible this ability to to to 3Drender uh what's taking place underneathhow is that going to assist us in how weunderstand reefs around the world wellthere's selfish uses and then there's uhmore altruistic I guess uses some of themore broader impacts as we can start tounderstand how energy get gets diffuseduh to protect our coastlines you knowwaves they're not just uh resources forus Surfers waves are resources from alot of coastal communities to disperseheavy energy and storms that occur inthe middle of the ocean they protect thecoastline they disperse again thatenergy in a in a way that doesn't justcause beaches to get eroded orinfrastructure to get pulled out intothe sea so understanding more about howthese features um transfer energy anddissipate energy they can be implementedinto understanding where to build wherenot to build where restore and to takeaway from a surfing perspective uhfinding these features once we start toidentify key features that areconsistent at waves like pipeline acloud break kurukuru mangi what theycall it or tah which we've been mappingnow we can find those same re featuresusing satellites or drones or diving andsay hey there's some potentially newwaves here that are are yet to bediscovered instead of waiting for a wavebreaking we can look at restructures tofind New Waves I love it you know Iremember growing up there were so manyconversationsespecially mid to late '90s early2000s um we thought we were going to seethis proliferation of artificial reefsuh structures that are man-made but putin the ocean to create some of ourfavorite waves in the world what hasbeen the hindrance in man being able toto to meet nature at nature no oneactually modeled it to understand okayI'm going to make a wave that is a goodwave they just throwsandbags it's like it's like soprimitive to think like Why didn't itwork oh because they just are guessingjust random let just randomly throw somestuff Mother Nature is not random noit's it's it's millions of years ofrefining uh so yeah they're all allbenefits um it's interesting and it'sjust something where you can map a reefwith a GoPro or you can map a reef withuh the camera you take to film eachother surfing anyone has the ability andthat's what we are trying to do in ourlab is to share you can use the samecamera that you capture beautifulsurfing with you can also capturesomething that is going to help theenvironment understand more about ourHumanity so you know let's Empowerpeople to know that you can have a goodtime and party for the planet at thesame time awesome and thank you for youryour wonderful Insight matal J L dropalmost goes nose heavy I mean it's rareto see him NOSdive remember we are on a quest here uhto Crown a men's Champion here at theVans pipe Masters and we've alreadycrowned uh a women's champion anincredible final the women reallysetting the tone for what's taking placetoday Aaron Brooks in fourth place withfollowed by Carissa Moore Molly Pam andMoana Jones Wong wow how's moana's wayslook at thisthingwow some people just have the Mana onthe day rightand look Imean those were some of the best wavesyet so far incredibleperformance$100,000 and now a twotime two time Vans pipe Master again asyou talked about to be a native Hawaiianthat kanaka that that uh how inspiringthat[Music]is oh and her her her best friends herhusband chairing her up the beach ahsuch a such an amazing end to thewomen's competition and the legacy of ofof of the title is obviously the mostimportant thing being a pipe Master butreally have to like hand it to Vansespecially at a time in which the surfindustry finds itself in a bit of adrought it is not easy to be aprofessional Surfer uh these days butVan's putting a primary Financialinvestment in the structure of thisevent and also uh for the pay and equalpay for the men and women 100,000 forfirst 75 50 25 um that's life changinggamechanging money uh for all of ourcompetitors uh and we are grateful somuch just an honor to be able to sit inthe booth with you uh and tell thesestories as well oh I mean it's I I evencan't believe that we're here speakingon behalf of these competitors for pipeMasters in an industry that is seeing alot of change across the landscape thereare still uh individuals andcorporations that are stepping up toensure the culture stays alive yeah andpipe Masters we we surfing wouldn't bethe same if we didn't have a pipe MasterCraig takingoff you had that Wing cranked ready togo mhm reminder to you at home our men'sfinal will be taking place in 90 minutesfrom now420 at 420 so I'll say it again at4:20 our men's final will be takingplace soprepareaccordingly you know what todocorrection look at that they throw usunder the bus our producers tell us onething and they're like oh actually it'snot the final that starts at 420 it'sthe ceremony the award ceremony was Iwould doing the math I was like thatseems quick our award ceremony uh willbe taking place at 420 there's abeautiful stage that was just builtYesterday by our crew just behind wherewe arecommentating and how about thiscrowdon aTuesday there's a there is a Saturdaylike a Saturday style crowd here uh on aTuesday here on the NorthShore muchbigger crowd today uh than we hadyesterday and all passionate surffans these folks making the wisechoice I wonder what the ratio is offolks on vacation to like I don't have ajob and that's okay I can just come andwatch surfing I mean judging bythe look I would sayvisitors well who knows you know timesarechanging might be the new residence hereon the NorthShore I'm not touching itI'm not not touching it I'm not touchingit hey 2 minutes and 20 seconds to gohere in heat seven round three uh noadDean Baron mamia Craig Anderson matahdrle as you said we said earlier all ofthese Surfers are people who are lookingfor two scores uh to break into that topfour spot remember we've got MichaelFebruary who is sitting just just on thebubble there in the fourth spot how howis this only one one and a half minutesleft in this heat that that seemed tojust re next he's going to befiring of course I mean you heard RoyRussell 45 minutes on 45 minutes off ohman Rory gave a gave a speech thissummer inHuntington he was was on his birthday 70years old and he stood up on stage andstarted off with I madeit I told[Laughter]you oh that man has lived a thousandlives and to see just how passionate andjoyful he is after all these years youheard him earlier being like hey 60years of watching this wave and havingrelationship with Pipeline and I mean hegave us such incredible context into howpipeline works and it he literally spokethe next two Heats into existence ifyou're just joining us right now for areminder this is not your average WLevent this is a WSL sanctioned specialtyevent the Vans pipe Masters and here isjust a quick snap at how this eventformat[Music]works[Music][Music]that ends Heat s round three didn'tmanifest for the boys hereunfortunately sofrustrating for them to say theleast as again MichaelFebruary Seth Mon and Billy keer youknow they're they're allvulnerable all within a point of eachother John John with that what seemed tobe like just random pipe wave and in areallychallenging heat with his brothers andemo coming through with that27.9 to put him up at 68 points andchange as here we are in round threeheat8 can we get 45 minutes on Mother Naturecan we get 45 minutes on for BrunoSantos Lucas chanka FinnMcgill and MaPang all in we'll see exactly what eachsererneeds yeah it looks like uh it'sinteresting to seeing the different finsetups the quad definitelyproviding a bit morespeed versus the Thruster which do youprefer in ways waves of consequence uhit depends for me on the speed mostlyfor waves that I feel you want to slowdown a bit more and personally get morecritical on drops I prefer Thruster uhfor waves that have a bit simpler oreasier entry but wanting to really drivethrough Barrel sections I would say quadsoin my mind um a wave like pipeline I'dprefer a Thruster and at the back door Iwouldn't mind umquad allright I like a quad too in in when Ifeel like I really need to go fast andchop through somesections that extrapump well joining us uh in the boothright now the pride of SanClemente Kira pinkton hello happyTuesday to you welcome thank you so muchthanks for having me we are honored tohave you how would you describe thisthis Vans pipe Master's experience foryou this year yeah I'm super excited tobe here I watched it all last year and Iwas kicking myself that I wasn't in itand um the first day was insane secondday made it a little bit tougher cuz uhdidn't really know where to surf andthen today was really good day to end itwhen you say you weren't in it was itdid you not get an invite or did youhave an injury no I just didn't have aninvite and I really wanted to be here sowhat did what what did that look likefor you to say I really want to be inthis what did that year look like fromDecember of last year to December ofthis year or whenever you got yourinvite what were the steps um well Imean this year I was doing a lot ofcontests so I wasn't really um doingmuch in terms of barrels but I've beengoing to Indo a lot and so I've beenspending time out there learning andtrying to get barreled and I feel like Ifelt like I deserved to be here but umthis year I didn't really do as good asI wanted to so I'm hoping I can step itup next time I like I thought it wasreally interesting that you made thechoice uh to put yourself in the waterwith three former pipe Masters was thatwhat was the your thought behind that umI just feel like when you're in thewater with people who push you you kindof step it up a lot more and um Carissawasn't in the heat yet when I chose itand so when she got put in there I waslike wow I really screwed myself herebut I was actually super stoked to be ina heat with them especially if I want tobe on the CT like they're all CT Surfersand um yeah they were pushing me andthey're all Hustlers it was fun wetalked a lotabout as we see I'm kind of paying latedrop oh you you literally saw the stepsthose ribs that you talked about as ashis board had to negotiate them and twosteps down he wasout what did you what did you learn Kirauh about pipeline in this experience umyeah I mean I haven't really served pipemuch I hurt myself a long time ago hereand I kind of never paddled back out andum just there's a lot behind it I feellike the people who do really good hereput so much time in and you can reallysee it shows um I have a lot of respectfor people who do good here and um itwas actually really bombear didn't dosuper good cuz he's amazing uh but yeahwatching um Harry Bryan on that last onelike that was that was crazy I'm reallyenjoying thisevent as we see UMakaskipping Into the Danger Zone on hislast wave and Finn had a wave before andnow he's up again looking for these endCorners just to getbusy I mean they're doing the best theycan to make the most out of of trulychallenging conditions as this wind hasonly gottenstronger in your uh campaigns in the inthe qualifying series you're generallyspeaking in priority forers Heats andyour your mind is locked in to a certainsort of structure of of of of how to towork through that you find yourself in acompletely different situation here inno priority how awkward was it andwhat's your takeaway of the experienceuh yeah I mean I don't I I haven't donea heat without priority since I wasprobably like 12 years old so it wasdefinitely trippy it felt like we're atthe beginning of a heat the entire timecuz everyone's trying to push each otherdeeper like put each other out ofposition and then when the wave cameyou're like so focused on being in theright spot but then someone else couldbe just a little bit deeper so I was Iwas kind of struggling cuz I'm also likeI don't know I'm notsuper like knowledged with this wave tooso like trying to find the right spotbut not be too deep or too wide justit's another Factor so it was it wastough but I was I was stoked I washaving fun how would you say thisexperience sort of shapes your you knowyou you talked about like I had a reallybad wipe out here and that kind ofspooked me didn't really want anythingto do with it then you saw the eventtaking place last year and you're like Ithink I'd like to be a part of it nowthis experience how does it sort ofaffect your goals um for yourrelationship with pipeline um yeah I'mwishing I put in a lot more time thelast few years I just kind of rattledmyself I was like 15 and paddled out waslike 10 ft 22 seconds should have nevergone out um so I was always surfing OfftheWall G out I'm sorry when you describedit before I was like I was thinkingpicturing like a sixoday I should have never paddled out Idon't know what I was thinking wellthat's like the be that's like thebeginning of a horror film where you'relike oh this is the person who's goingto go first yeah no I think everyone waskind of expecting it and then I ended upon the beach and they're like oh yepthere's the little girl who paddled outthere well salute to you that was kindof like a win that you actually made itback to land on that day but you'd liketo keep like to keep pushing yourselfout here yeah um definitely I want totake a lot more time to be out here Ifeel like even though I was here for twoweeks before the event I still like knownothing about this wave and so I'mhoping for next year I'll just give it alot more time and spend a lot more timethis yeartoo well it seems like you did a goodjob it seemed that you have a uh you'rea quick learner out there seen you getsome nice waves out during thiscompetition and it seems likeyou're going to be all that much betterfor it next year when you're coming outhopeso 19 minutes andchange AAP Pang isthe only person in this heat who needs asingle score uh that could change thingsfor Mikey February which he can do yeswhich he can do by anymeans if that wave comes to him talk alittle bit about M's uh sort of Legacythat he comesfrom here atpipe I mean he if you look at just hisdad his dad is an amazing shaper boardBuilder uh for the Town and Countrylabel uh has shap boards for so manyLegends before and currently uh hedefinitely has the insightand you know he it's not just his his inaddition to the Legacy he has a TightCrew Wana Jones Wong he has uh Baronmamia Noah bashin uh his tight group ofthe next generation of pipeline Surfersuh they and they're the generation abovethem they look up to that's Eli and anduh Nathan and Ivan you know thesethey're right there in the mix CoRothman so they they have learning fromsome really talented pipelineSpecialists well doing this little lulllet's check in with Holly who's with acouple of Legends Go Happy Happy gollucky Noah Dean and Craig Anderson higuys yeah I'm here at the fat tie barhaving a little refresh drink with thelads uh neither of you made the top fourbut who's you pick for the day uh who'sin the final topall right now yeah uhJohn John Billy camper Seth moners andMikey F at the moment well I'm going togo with South what about Benji BenjiBrandt where's he sitting oh really I'dlove to see him get right up it andsneak in there beautiful all rightyCraig I heard you did 50 push-ups theother dayyour arms still s or what no they'redoing pretty good definitely not 50 offthe bat I was doing I did 45 two at atime been training realhard yeah you're looking absolutelyyolked looking yank all right we'llenjoy the drinks and uh thanks forcomingJack Craig JackAnderson Noah flexiDean and Holly wsky Wan at the barAustralians just they can't help but bemostly happy all the time yeah do younotice that in your travels yeah they'realways having the best times I feel likeit's pretty cool to watch it's a glasshalf full existence99.9% of thetime as we look in the Horizon thislooks likeanother I don't know Gori is this are weon the are we are we on on the off yeah45 minutes on 45 minutes off I mean it'sit's so clear now those those wind wavesare definedyeah and this is what's going tointensify over the next week forecast itto intensify so those who will remain onthe NorthShore the visitors um they'reprobably going to be looking for somemore sheltered waves uh those who livehere will go to the waves that areshelter I hope that some of those thatlive here will perhaps lead me to jointhem in the Quest for shelter I'm justgoing to put that out there now thenjust searchin for for folks who who maybe haven'tbeen watching and and listening to yourdetailed explanation they might be goingbut I've been watching I was watchingearlier today and the waves weren'trunning off why are they closing up notlike this Dr Kono well I mean that onelooked pretty decent you have one partyou have the sand again still towardsthe end section here uh that could beshutting it down you also have the swellDirection starting to change you don'thave the more Westerly swell as it firststarted to come in this morning uh it'snow shifting more towards the north soagain you go from this really nice swellCorridor which allows for those pipelinelefts to come in and of now you have a abit more North Direction kind of runningoff the reef but it still has thosewests so now you have shutting down onboth back door and at pipe whichunfortunately is creating a bit of pickand chooseand need a little luck to find thatyourself in the right position as kirwas saying you know it's not just youryourum your early entry into pipeline lineupbut also you see experienced people MakPang you know uh Finn who is as apipeline pro- Champion they're findingdifficulty out there so again it'sdifficult conditions but it's still uhagain coming down to what sets apartthose people who you see in the top fourum and apart from probably Mikey whothrew out the Good Vibes and came backwith a the right vibration to tap intothose back door waves uh John John Billyand Seth they are they hunt those wavesthey're they move yeah on the reef yeahMikey's I think his best wave was somuch farther down than like your normalback door wave too was like he he waskind of like in the right position forthat wave yeah he was paddling back outafter getting destroyed yeah uh gettingpounded by those off-the-wall backdoor I don't know how much this affectsit but when you woke up this morning itwas literally flat and now it's big doesthat kind of like make the waves not asgood or is that matter too much wellwhen you when the the sand was very muchfilled up in the reef and now you havetheSW Rising it's it's it's pulling thatsand off the reef but again you usuallywant big westwells to pull the sand offof The Reef uh but this is a moreNorthwest North facing swell soit's kind of just packing it in everyset a little bit goes back on the reef alittle bit gets taken offso definitely when it's flat it the sandaffects the wave and that's when you seethe that back wash I don't know if youhad some back wash in your heat yeahyeah little bit there was like a weirdchop especially on the right though theleft actually we had we got pretty luckyit wasglassy we have some movement to chumbogoing for itoh that does not feel good man you justhope that they penetrate that's thebiggest hope looks like he's stillunder where ishe it's crazy from the beach you justsee it he is you don't see that muchpower and the other day I just bailed onone and I didn't come up for so long Iwas starting to get a little worried andthen I could hear waves going over meand like board broke and thank God Icame up oh godwow nothing when you're in thatsituation Kira what where do you go tosort of notpanic okay weird enough a long time agoI saw this bird sitting in the skycompletely still and it was there forlike an hour just completely still butit was like hunting something so it wasin like complete Focus and I just thinkof that bird and just complete Stillnessand it like helps me like control mybreathing I feel like so then when I'mholding my breath I'm just like notpanicking Bruno Santos pulling into ohthat one looked like it almost couldhave been makeable that's amazing yeahso when you're out there getting Ppounded and you're feeling that leashcord stretch and you're hearing waterrunning over you like the possibility ofanother wave going overhead perhapshaving a two-wave hold down you're justfocusing on that bird that bird is my Idon't know it's my calmness I guessthat's killer that's I just learnedsomething that's uh that's hopefullythat you use that not just when you'regetting pounded by the waves I use itall the time before I reheat I'm likedoing breath work and I just think ofthat bird it's like my spirit animal orsomething where did this take place inum Ventura there was just I don't knowit was up in the hills we were surfingum kind of like actually I don't evenknow where we were it's like a beachbreak but this bird was just thereforever and we I couldn't stop watchingit and I just your spirit animal me yeahyour spirit animal said hey KiraStillness like me yep will carry you farand it'll it'll just pop up in my head Idon't even have to like think of it it'sjust like oh well it's time to be calmwe're we're getting worked we might notcome back up I like to think when whenI'm getting pounded I think of a SophieBelle I would start laughing and andchoke water and die if I startedthinking of SophieBell jumbo that girl charges she's yeahshe charge she charges and she has themost care for she's like chicken Joe mhmlike she's justcruising Bruno looking for that exit butgobbled by the white water that wouldhave been a cool one oh why I say Sophiejust when she was in here talking withus we were asking her do you wear awatch like I don't I don't know time Iknow reef sand I don'tknow my favorite line was I don't have awatch but I ask people what time it isall thetime if you don't like Sophie Bell itsays a lot a lot about you as a persontwo pipeline Warriors Benji Brown somesaying the best pipeline wave so far ofthe season and the Hawaiian Powerhousekaana APO run her uplast year runner up such an incredibleevent last year with colana coming fromjust really feeling he didn't know if heshould have got in you know the drawswere it was the first invitation

second place col up thepeople's champ people's Champion bigparty in town after for him oh yeah itwas like he won huh is like he wonthat's awesome shout out to Scottyfountain in town with the rest of thecrew at SummerStreet chumbo lookingagainlooks tough like not a lot ofopportunity and everyone's kind ofscrambling it looks like you folks hadkind of a killer moment today forcompetition kind of oh no we we got thebest of it forsure when they showed replays of moana'sfinal waves I was like yeah yeah we wegot lucky yeah I mean it wasstreamy I mean critical but like thedream waves that were ridden by thewomen today completely stand out it keptit pretty on your toes because there wasa lot of high scoring waves coming whereis it seems in the men's and these thesefinal Heats there's tens and zeros likethere's not a lot of high scoringpotential to do work yeah how long agowas Harry Bryant's wave maybe an hourhour and a half hour and a half whichwas a after a low for a long low Sethyeah about a 45 minute lull beforeyou're right before Seth man and theygot theirs back to back and the onlyother sort of real standout wave afterthat was was John John's wave yeah whichwas yeah not as good asHarry's Taro watab Taro watab styleKing who is on the rise if you haven'tseen his new edit should check itout is this become more common place asmoh M leaning in WoW driving let's golet's gohey that's what we were talking aboutare we we see a you think we're seeing ashuffle and the only person in this heatwho needs a single score it was M Pangoh looking for a 22.6 is that going tobe the score to take Mikey February outI I wouldn't be with what's being well Idon't what's being thrown out today we'seen some interesting things I don'tknow we'll take a look at it again butthat was a that was a pretty criticalwave Mak and you could you could tell assoon as he stood up and turned into ithe was like yeah well this too we we'relike on the screen and it's like sozoomed in you're kind of like what it'shard to know because you don't see thefull wave as you're you know we'relooking at like this as he takes off onthe boil drops in sets the rail one pumpholds it knowing okay I'm out stoshestok oh man I mean there's not manyopportunities right now I think this isgoing to go pretty wow yeah that thingheed so careful bro don't jum head firsthe almost got like a Chip Shot off ofthe boil yeah on that takeoff he'sanother one that does these late dropstoll hangers and he's just into itthat's so comfortable this is like aroll in tohim and the way he negotiates that thatfirst rib that came up the face justlike pumped over it I I would I would besurprised if he doesn't get that scorethat he needs well I mean that's sevenand change right across the board sevenyeah seven and change across the boardI'm I'm thinking that he's probablygoing to I'm going to say he's going toget it not not going to Waffle Bruno Strying to look for a similarsituation uh running off I mean that wasand again if we we look at the thecriteria of wave selection also cominginto the factor and when it's atliterally needle and the Hy stack stylepipeline I wonder how much of that willfactor in aswell yeah I feel like it'd be hard tojudge a day like this because it's sodifferent from two hours ago that a wavelike that is just like so rare totallyit's hard to get it chumbo oh goshhammering through trying to find hisrail ah again in thesoup he's thinking about the bird rightnow you know the bird got him through ychumbo he he's a machine he'll do that20 times in a rowhe's you know he's so happy gol luckybut in the waterhe'sTerminator looks like he got it whatMaka has moved into second place wowgood job bro and so if the final was tohappen right now it would literally beall Hawaiian at the Vans pipe Mastersthe score for Mak Pang coming through at28.8 wow Three N in change yeahsee youknowit seems like the pipeline potential ishigher scoring than the back doorwhich not to say that it wasn't thatgreat of a wave that was a a great waveyou know looking at that you know youcompare that to say Billy's wave earlierum are they have to you know look backand think they cannotforget the scoringsystem 2 minuteswell we send our congratulations toMichael February for a incredibleperformance overall as he sits now inthat fifthspot and he was in that in a heat thatwas wave starved and wasn't able to makea difference right on that boil rightgetting Barrel over those cracks thatwe're talking about over the reef andblown out right into that channellook atthis I mean that was a lot to negotiatestok and how that instant fire allheart such an amaz you know kaana andBenji are frothing right now they'relike yes those are the waves we like youknow Benji's like maybe I go a littlebit deeper you know maybe colana is likemaybe I stall you know now they'relooking at each other how do we improveon what exists if we get the wavebecause it's hard to now beat that WaveIt's hard to find one of those waves andhow are you going to beat the score umwhen you have something that's executedsoperfectly does uh Benji or colana haveany good waves already or or Benji hasone right Benji has one yeah cuz I feellike if you have at least one or two beeasier but it's so tough out there rightnow to two would be way if you have twobetter than way way better yeah yeah asuh Maka just he won the lotterybasically he's so stoked now he's justtrying to keep people off wav yeah nowhe's battling he's just trying to try tokeep it he wants it so bad he's sostoked but he's looking pretty good hereat

fromstraight waves not even coming waves notcoming got at all today look at thatcurrent ripping through theinside yeah it's uh it's a special placepipeline you think you can just paddlestraight out next thing you know you'redown my Rocky Pointmhm there's a reason people paddle downthe beach to paddle out to this wave isthere is acurrent that's trying to find its wayback out to the lineup and you have toride that current around the edge andhopefully shoot the Gap if not you'llprobably be making the Walk of Shame Iwas just going to say there's nothingworse than paddling out getting caughtin that current and then just horribletiming where you end up in between pipeand gums just getting pounded I don'tthink there's ever been a surfer thathasn't missed time Pipeline and then yougot to come in and walk up the beachhead down some guys just keep paddlinguntil they finally get out it's almostbetter to just paddle way down and comearound and actually have to walk back upto beach nobody wants to do that nobodywants to look anybody in the eye if theygotdenied deniedoh who is thattaita just a quick pocket ride up anddown your Surfer inblue wow look how bumpy it is justtrying to slow down alot is that Benji wow look at that bumpytakeoff oh how much I can't believe hestayed on his feet how much points doeshe get for that look at thebackwash it's crazy out there it's it'sdefinitely not perfect pipeline it isdefinitely whoever wins today is goingto have their work have had their workcut out for them especially surfing thisevening you're going to have to pick andchoose I mean here we might have ourfirst cleanup set to wash guys wash guysthrough the lineup that'll be prettycool show you guys what it looks like toget mowed down onTV and here itcomes let's see if anybody's too deepand gets caught Inside byit two surface outback I think our other two surface hadcotton waves so they're safe in thechannel was one ofthem you're going have to be reallyselective mhm that one that one was goodtill it wasn't that was not that one wasgood till it wasn't by any chance it wasnot a goodwave there aren't very many good wavesout there MAA f diamond in the roughlike a real diamond in

four minutes remainingladies and gentlemen here in heatN9 the second to the last Heat of theround before the final and the lastchance for these fourSurfers to try and do what isneeded to be able to get into one ofthose coveted four spots that are up forgrabs anybody'sgame and here we go with a rip goingright through the middle ofpipeline being a pipeline surfing andbeing in the lineup and seeing the ripcome through the lineup is got to be oneof the most irritating things can everhappen to you mhm you're sitting thereat 3 minutes you need a score and it'sabsolutely ripped out Imean nothing you can do maybe that'swhere they got the term ripped out fromsomething that's like real bad vibes andsucks someone that's rippedoutme with 2 minutes and 43 seconds hereyou got to be thinking Benji and Taroare like I need awave please please please 2 minutes and30 seconds away from either jumping inone spot closer to 100,000or one step closer dumping into thedonationpot you has donated your time and yourefforts but sorry sir not today allright so if the 4 Hawaiians that are inthe top spots right now do end up in thefinals I guess you got one kanaka andthree Hawaiians mhm just those four whodo you got your money on to win thewhole thing uh right now I'm going to gosetmon I'm going to go John John he'salways a safe bet yep but got to go thepeople on thisone our one Hawaiian blooded surfer inthe final so far set Mon and we backingset mon100% right now in thisevent Billy keer always a threat evenwith a brokenfoot Billy keer is right there59.60 he's in the mix he's no strangerto competition and winning events sowe'll see what Billy cando had that amazing wave in his lastHeat M Pang is just he's always keepingit real that's one of the BRS that youknow what I mean you can always knowwhat you're going to get when you seeMaka coolest BR such a warrior out hereat pipeline all right one minuteremaining in thisheat second to last here of theday Surfers needing somescores hope isfadingit's like when the light at the end ofthe tunnel starts fading starts gettingdarker and darker and the piano and theviolin startplaying they're going to ask you do youwant some cheese with that wine when youget to the beach I'm sure there's somewhining going on out here today oh Ishould have done this should have couldhave would have but you never you had achance and the only ones that have achance coming up in the next seat as yousee sitting there in the Channel withKal Grace bam stockRussell bery and Shawnmanners what do you think Russell beryand Shawn manners are thinking right nowafter seeing their mate brought HarryBryant get thatwave I think they'rethinking if he can do it it's it's outthere it's possible those wavesexist although I don'tknow that Harry brand wave was kind of aunicorn I mean yeah that wassometimes it's better to be lucky thanbe good and uh the lucky you are thebetter you get sometimes and uh out hereat pipeline luck is always your bestfriend yes New York New York New Yorkwhat's up your boy Ballam stockspaddling out bam stack call Grace RHawai in from the northan manners waAustralia and Russell berky from Allahdala newWales one American two Australians andone Hawaiian in this heat so there wasno shakeups to the leaderboard in thatlastHeat but we got one more heat to gothings could change what do these guysactually need it' be pretty cool to seethe actual numbers in real time exactlywhat they need because I don't thinkanybody really has one high score Ipretty pretty sure they both need two Ithink they all need a combinationexcellent scoresyes it's hard enough to get one waveright now in these conditions especiallyright now that's going to betough but you never know makua how manytimes you been out here at this hour inthe afternoon and pipes looking messylike this and then all of a sudden thewind changes something like somethingsome little thing just Chang changes andall of a sudden it just turnson I really hope that it does thatbecause from all the years that I havesat here and watched this wave once itturns like this it doesn't stop thisNorth Direction with this northeast windis usually not something that backs offImean I'm only human I make mistakes Icould be wrongbut from my experiences out here I thinkthese conditions will stickaroundthere you see on your screen Russellbery with the highest score single wavescore out of any Surfer in this heatnonetheless he will also need twoexcellent wave scores to crack into thattopfour walking up the beach[Music]kif I'm not mistaken one of Eva Beach'sfinest everybody out there in Campbelltown how Bush boys where you guysat everybody about a Chase sure you guysare watching call rightnowala and we had apaddle but nogoal look like a little Tepe here in thebackground on this one could be it'llsplit the peak what do you know let'ssee oh it's call Grace nice here we goleft oh spin was going left wow get inthereRuss dang just a little too far in frontof it but oh Kal should have went forthatone a little too far in front of it butman my hat's off for that whip that whiparound I mean if you're going to let awave that perfect go by I mean someone'sgoing to catch it especially right nowand uh had Russell been able to stall alittle bit more or take off deeper wherekala was that would have been excellentexcellent up in that 28 to 30 range Ibelieve nonetheless it was still abeautiful ride I mean as critical as itgets out here at pipeline just not thedeepest Barrel compared to what we'vebeen seeing getting a really high scorestoday walk us through thisreplayI mean such a critical drop but yeah hejust needs to be a little deeper you yousee that whitewash that was behind himyou would have caught that crumble fromthewhitewash right back there could havebeen in the barrel but I mean what elsemore could he really have done I mean nofrom the position he was in he he surfedthat excellent excellently also berkysurfed this W excellent turning aroundwhipping grabbing Dragon pulling underthat was a pretty close to perfectlyexecuted ride by Russell berky on thatone 22 minutes remain in the final heatof round threethis is the last Heat last chance forSurfers to crackinto those last four spotskiing so Maka how hard maybe explain forthe viewers how hard is it to make thatlast minute decision and just whiparound and almost like no paddletakeoff drop on the wave like that on awave likepipeline that decision is a big onesometimes you know but uh and it's ait's a split second decision well thatdecision it's not hard to make thedecision it's hard to follow throughwith the decision it's hard to executeit's hard to execute the whip you whiparound anybody can whip around and makelike they're going but to actually goand pull into thatBarrel to find out more

out there like I don't knowanother woman that puts in as much timeas you do which is why you surf thiswave so good um you've really put in thetime and and gotten that experience andit it shows in your surfing every timeyou peddle out so oh thank you K I wantto know what your biggest um confidencebooster is out there knowing that peopleare going down knowing that this wave isso powerful and and and dangeroussometimes what what gives you thebiggest motivation or the confidence toget out out there and do it time andtime again even though not every timeyou make it I don't know honestly likewhen I go out there I actually feel likeI have zero confidence I actually feellike I'm going to get smoked every timeI paddle out until I paddle for a waveor actually until I see my wave comingfor me and then all of a sudden like Ijust my brain just turns off and I gointo like this like this state where Idon't even think and she just smilesyeah I guess I just smileso I I'm curious so tell me you know atthe start of the day you were not inthat fourth place spot you had toscratch your way into that spot in yourheat um how does it feel to not even bein contention and then claw your way inthere and win the whole thing like Isaid like this is like I am speechlesslike that's what I said when I first gotout of the water and they tried tointerview me and I was like I'mspeechless hi I don't know what tosay it's crazy like I I don't have crazyconfidence in me I am like not aconfident person which is so weirdbecause you have so many accomplishmentsnow you are the most accomplished femalein competitions at pipeline you have wonmore contest at pipeline than any otherwoman ever uh that doesn't it doesn'tsense that doesn't boost your confidenceat all no it actually does the oppositeit makes me like freaked out like Icouldn't even eat breakfast this morningI pukedeverywhere yeah so do you feel a lot ofpressure uh to like live up like youthey call you the queen of pipeline doyou feel like an immense pressure tolike live up to that title every time Ido like when I'm on the land I liketotally remember that and I'm like ohI'm the queen of pipe like I got to dothis I got to do that but then when I'min the water then for some reason I justforget everything and I just think aboutme and pipe me and Pipeline and all Iwant to do is just enjoy like her you'vehad a really great relationship withpipeline since you were I mean when didyou start serving pip you were like ateenager right yeah I mean the firsttime I paddled out I was 12 and Idropped in and nose pearled got

let's go serfpipe and I was like no I don't want togo surf pipe like I don't know how tosurf out there and they kind of pushedme and then uh one day I never calledthem I never talked to anybody and Ijust grabbed my little board which wascompletely the wrong size and I justwent out the pipe and sat in the channeland it was like second reef and I sawall my friends catching like the mostcraziest barrels and I was just likewhoa I want to do that one day like oneday if I could ride one wave like thisthis would make me the happiest girl inthe world that's why you always havethat big fast smile

do you want to master next I don'twant to master any other Wes feel likeI'm good this is my spot I'm good I'mjust going to rain Supreme right herethis is enough stress forme wellyou have definitely earned everythingthat you've accomplished here so sayingthat we have the top four so far Hawaiiguys John Florence ma Pang Billy keerset mon who would you be cheering for inthat final that's really hardbecause that whole group I really likeall of them I look up to all of them butMaka is like my brother he was the firstperson I had a sleepover with I learnedhow to ride a bike with him like we'vebeen friends since we're in diapers andif he won thiscontest the same time that I won thecontest this is like a dream come trueyeah well there you go there's yourcurrent top 10 on the screen and yourcurrent top number one in the studiowith us the queen Moana Jones chiming inon this heat you have John Florence infirst p in second Billy keer in thirdSeth mon in fourth and pretty much theonlyperson in the draw that has a chance isMr Russell bery he needs a22.9 and we all know he is so verycapable of getting that score we gotabout 11 minutesleft and this is the last Heat beforethe final this is the last of the lastthere you got onscreen Mr John JohnFlorence thePhenom from such a young age there areonly very very few people on planetEarth that from that young of an agehave theability to make peoplewatch and know that one day they willbecome one of the greatest ever and JohnFlorence has done that time and timeagain I mean congratulations to Johnhe's got his owncompany he's got a great team behind himhis beautiful wifeLauren so Moana package who else wereyou impressed with on the women's sidein this event I Aaron Brooks reallySteed it up she did she was sending ityes she was and Molly was going offMolly was on fire I haven't seenbackhand Barrel riding by woman out atpipe like that since forelle Ballardyeah yeah I think right now Molly islike the best backside Barrel rider inthe world for women yeah she definitelywasn't letting up she was right on yourheels oh yeah she was right on my heelsand I I knew that and it was funny afterI caught my second wave she's like whatdo you think that was you think that wasbetter than your first and I'm like whatare you trying to see how much youneed you know that's what she was doingwhat about the positioning there you'relike you're like sorry girl I put thenail in the cin yeah but check this outevery time you guys went back to thelineup it was you outside Molly rightbehind you and then there would beCarissa more on the inside and itstarted off like that the middle of theheat it was like that and at the end ofthe heat was like that so I waswondering they must have they must haveknown that someone knew the reef prettygood out here and uh maybe they thoughtthey could pick a few straps off if thequeen allowed and she only allowed onescore to slip by and then she was likeoff with their heads and I'm off to theraces $100,000 later a second pipelineMaster's title couldn't have happened toa better person I'm very blessed verythankful well this heat has not beenthat blesseduh it's 8 minutes left and uh it's beenpretty lackluster to say the leastuh Uncle Ray over there oh bamBallam nicepoof so I guess are the only people thatare confirmed in the final right now isJohn John Florence and MCC ping I don'tthink anybody's confirmed because ifguys get three waves they can still getit but I mean as of now it's pretty muchthey're look they're feeling prettyconfident pretty much three guys yeahyou never want to be well you know youwere you were sitting on the fourthbubble was on the bubble but I mean nowlook baller I'm guaranteed better that12 so he's going to need another score 7minutes left Russell berky can get a 22no problem ball around stat can get anyscore out here no problem so I don'tthink anybody's really safe yet yeahit's justuh look how bumpy that wave was you seehis board justlike the chops get under his board thatboard doesn't look like it works as goodas the Kim board he wasriding it's kind of squirly yeah itlooked a little squirly did yeah yeahlook at that spit look even on thatbottom turn turn it's just kind of uh uhuh I mean ball surf so good you can tellwhen hisequipment's well I think the bump on theface has a lot to do with it too yeahbut I mean cuz it looks bumpy you seensome of those drops he was taking lastyear that was pretty roll inish and uhhis board was sticking to the face LikeGlue last year look at that big spitfact I was actually riding the sameboards is ball on today oh yeah y samemodel must not be the arrow must be theshooter because you made your boardslook like butter oh yes look almost likelike you could ride a door you rip thevcam door off and go out there and inthe contestalready amazing ballaround I guess it's not the bow or thearrow kala Grace is just chomping at thebit I think he made a mistake early onletting that wave go and letting uh hemight have been a little too far behindit you know how you get behind the waveat Pipeline and you just can't pushyourself over the leg I just didn'tthink it looked like it was going tothrow grow that good you know what Imean it's pretty deceiving with thenorth Northerly Direction but then it'llhit a a double up and act you know fireacross that inside so you really got tobe selective I think today you mighthave to take some chances it'sespecially with 5 minutes to go youbetter be taking some chances let's callout Grace oh that one was no goodoh I think the wind is causing it tokind of be chandeler out there right nowit is your your final like your stokethe women went first and then the menand your final landed in the hour thatit did because uh I know the conditionswere just waves are absolutely perfectfor your is this the first time inhistory of surf competition that thewoman I don't know the H back shootoutwe got some good conditions though wegot good conditions we got some goodconditions I think there's a bomb comingI hear whistles I mean specificallydesignated woman women's divisionprobably the best I think so I wouldhave to agree yeah the who shootoutgirls and guys surftogether uhoh comes a set out the backfour minutesremaining everyone's scratching for thisscratching someone going togo that must be someone's itchy here wego he's up in ridingwhoa oh cousin oh it it gets ugly inthat inside yeah just a big I gotpounded earlier actually that's actuallypipeline's uh mother-in-law inthere where' he come up with these

mistakenwell we're about to get a new Vans pipeMasters winner for 2023 but let's take alook back at this video from last year'schampionB aroundstop my relationship with the motherpipeline is forever growing and foreverchanging she gave me something that Idon't know if I'll ever top in the restof my career and she was able to give mea win at a contest at pipe I neverexpected it in the first place to Fathomanother one is just like all right wellmaybe we do have that kind ofrelationship I don't know I'm not reallysure like I mean it's a world title forme to have this be my opportunity is allI could ask for and it is my world titleand if I could do that again i' Iwouldn't know how to pay her back but Iwas all I would want to[Music]do just imagine withuh a minute and 30 you paddled out withyour other Jersey on thinking you madethe Heat and one of these guys droppedan AB smoker yeah I I was thinking aboutjust take the guy's Jersey off and belike thanks when they were when theywere getting ready on the beach I waslike wait so what happens if the yeahthe situation changes like one of theguys in the water is actually going tobump into the top four and one of theguys on the beach in a jerseys like justget his whole day ruined yeah are theykind of jumping the gun right now byputting those jerseys on well one oneminute left there's one minute leftthere's not that many and who do we haveon screen here it's my brother rightthere m Moana andMaka we were sharing the same leashtoday there's your other brother ohthat's my boys oh he got the good luckleash why is he waiting for 44

golden love you guysaloha[Music]soInc herewego all Hawaiian men'sfinal John John Florence M Pang Billykeer and Seth Bonuh incredible performance from M Pang inheat seven excuse me heat eight uh tojump his wayup Billy keer also making that jumptoday Seth mon I mean John John Florenceis the only one who's left from Heat 2that was in that top four as theHawaiians made a hard charge to get usinto that final of course you were allaware of the incredible performanceby the newQueen reigning champ Moana Jones Wangand no doubt theseHawaiians deeply inspired by herperformance uh and to be able to havethis all Hawaiian finalHawaiianresidents and the native hawaian MH herein the finalmhm it's always an interesting represpresentation here when we ask I'm surethere's a lot of kanaka Hawai out therewondering when we sayHawaiians there's a a question what doesthat mean to be Haw does it mean youlive in Hawaii or does it mean you haveHaw ancestry and I think this is stillyet to be discussed within the surfingCommunity because we have people likeJohn John Florence who is without uhNative ha ancestry but is born andraised here in the islands uh whereasSeth MO is born and raised as well withkanaki ancestry the Koko as wesay um not too you know I think when werecognize there's differences then we'reable to marginalize those differencesbut to not recognize that there is infact a difference here in the islandswhen when I would be surprised if Iheard John say he's haai but I I verymuch appreciate when he says herepresents Hawaii Hawaii yes well Hawaiivery very well strongly represented inthis final and thank you for forpointing out those particulars tobecause to ignore uh The Roots cultureuh which is which flows through this uhthis population and through the throughthese islands uh would be a Miss 40minutes in this finaluh we are back in prioritymode priority top two scores determinthewinner scores from the first threerounds are no longer relevant it's awhole new game we are in the finals thecrowds are going crazy on the beachright now people are freaking out I haveto say you know Roy Russell described itso so accurately the many faces and thethe the es and flows uh of Pipeline andwe saw just before those this last Heatyou know it seemed like oh is this isthis going to beit Russellbery good good showing that he'samazing people are looking you knowright now the swell is flexing on thereef there are challenging conditionsbut insane waves to be ridden out hereeveryone's going to be tested these areall pipe Specialists out here balaramstack was the defending champion fromNew York last year one of the thingsthat balaram is known for over the yearsis being one of those you know you'relooking at messy messy Pipeline andyou're just like wondering what's goingon and then you're like is that a humanbeing out there and balaram would be oneof those people almost by usually byhimself yeah which amongst these fourSurfers uh are the ones that you wouldyou would see on on S of one of thoseunruly days where the opportunities areSlim but there's you could get a richreward you know every I would say everysingle one of theseSurfers if pipe hasn't been breaking ina while and it's breaking every one ofthem would be out even if it's unrulyand messy all four of these people havea special deep connection to pipelinethat they would be out even if it's bigand messy who's out there the most oftenprobably makana cuz he's the youngestyou know of the crew he's he's in thethe standing of where everyone sits outthere um yeah everyone wants perfectpipe for sure but I've seen John outwhen it's not that good and he somehowcan find the good ones and again whenit's big and messy and weird and crazythere's always those Diamonds in theRough the gems and these any one ofthese guys know how to get it we'll getin more into more of the particulars ofthese four and I'm going to put you onthe hot spot to make a pick the firstwill'll check in with the defendingchamp balaram stack who is withHolan balaram uh obviously last year's PMaster who's you picked for thisfinal um M of pay all day I would loveto see that dude go take it outespecially with the field he's got withhim right now I'll be stoked yeah andhow was it out there the conditions areobviously big and gnarly oh man it wasbig it was gnarly it was everything youcan fit into those two words and like Idon't know it was fun giving it a try itwas like either you're not catching awave or you're going over the falls oryou might get a good one and like kindof got a little in between of all thatso I don't know it was fun I had a greattime trying and I mean I heardbefore I went out my my brother's GRS Igot two nieces and a nephew Coensaraphina and and Kane and uh that waslike the motivation to get going likefinally last Heat like I was like yesthey're watching yeah but um no I'mstoked everybody back home that waswatching I'm like forever in Deb toeverybody so I'm feels good to be herenow and feels good to be on the beach sooh no I'm here now thank you guys thoughit's great time cheers thanks for comingenjoy a fewdrinks bam a humble past Champion yougreat job I love about bam you know wetalk about it all the time the way he isas you see some big big set marching inright now these guys are about to getcleansed there's a cleansing takingplace in thisfinal there's some perspective on thecleansing oh wow the swell is in cleansemode just breaking out the back nowfully realizing itself you see thosevideos of of John John uh doing thoseduck Dives where he goes underwater allthe way across a pooland uh you wonder if he's able to applysome of that right now as all fourSurfers getting flexed on but back tobalaramstack he's walked with such ahumility in his years since he was a kidcoming to the NorthShore earning hisspot in the vam house where you watchhim walk around uh in this community andhe is respected as if he is one of thecommunity yeah he's the he's thehonorary Hawaii resident here I think uhspending time and also again those bigand messy days he's out there by himselfwhen the people are out surfing pahiJaws WEA outside different places he'sout here at pipe waiting for it to justget small enough where it's not justwashing through like what we're seeinghereum oh the question is is it better toduck dive or do you bail on the secondI didn't see I didn't seeanyone bail theirboard I I think I seen MAA bail M bailor someone did you knowsometimes what do you what do you do Ibail I bail and I ride the white waterin I I take it all the way to the shoreand I runaway I'm a clutch I'm aclutcher I'm a clutcher my surfboard inthose situations becomes a uh a teddybear SL security blanket I had one atcloudbreak once you know you're you'reout there and it's like 6t and all of asudden 10 Footers start marching throughand you're in the wrong spot and you'relike okay well one thing we're going tonot do is we're not going to expire yeahand I like to clutch I but sometimes youtry to clutch it it just get rips out ofyour ripped out of your arms anyway I'vehad it duck diving and I've had um myteeth you know get my lip get cut and myface gets slammed by the board brokenboard so to me taking the humility roundtrip also uh it seems to me a betteroption either I break my leash or youknow I I get washed in but I've learnedpersonally for me when I duck dive onbig sets um there's more actionhappening the board might come hit hitme so I'm yeah I'm definitely more of aa thrower who's this John weirdyJohn how do you get how do you get doneduck diving all those waves and thendecide to try and go on something likethat that's he knows it's is like thisis his thing he's he's here for a reasonno stranger to winning and now he'sapplying it and when you're number onein a lot of people's minds and act inreality of standings or rankings there'sa lot torepresent can't just be like I meanthere's a bit of self self- pressure I'msure that he has for himself to want toperform at the highest level and thatcomes down in his mind okay whileeveryone's catching their breath myadvantage could be to turn around andget a wave and just establish the TheNarrative again maybe he's not inpriority right now I don't know what thepriority is going on righthere cuz priority is a thing in thefinals here top two waves count towardsyour final score so with the conditionslike like they are right now especiallywith all this sand how do those biggiant sets sort of will they affect thelineup in realtime I I think for deep water wavestaller waves bigger waves uh a lot ofsurfers like to look for a smoother faceit can smooth out the water for a asmoother face not as much bumps becauseon bigger waves you have bigger chopsand it's a lot bigger risk to hit thosechops at pipeline you see that alsostarts to floodthe water onto the reef causing a bit ofbatet so it's not set in stone that okaylet the first one go and the secondone's going to be smoother there mightbe too much water now from the previouswave coming in and now you don't havethat same amount of draw off the reef itcould affect negatively what the facelooks like yeah we saw like during oneof those really big sets in the lastHeat in that heat 10 like 3ft sidewaysrunning from south to North Across TheReef all right your current leader JohnJohn Florence with a one a one and aone we're going to see that change I'msure a one and a one and a one that hethat was felt though oh yeahhe we're hearing some noise out theresomething's happening and people justfreakingout I think people are just fired upthat we're in thefinalGreat Performances todayfrom you know John Florence to just puthimself Out Of Reach basically from aHunger Game perspective of of beingtaken out but Brothers M Pang Billy keerSeth mon all came in to the day knowingthat they needed awave and they they got they they settheir intention and they were able toaccomplish thatI mean it's you know everyone on theNorthShore whether they competed theyare no longer in the finals in therunning to the people who haven't got inthe contest who we know as part of thiscompetition deserve a spot to be herethe the Shaden picaros and the AAStewarts that are out there who put timeand time again um the Sheldon pons thatare you know working their way to showthey deserve a spot they're watchingthis too and they're stoked they'reeveryone is rooting for someone you gotmultiple Generations here that arerepresented in this lineup in this finalfrom John to Maka Billy and Seth peoplefrom Town Country you got outer Islandwe got people who are from the youngfresh crop it's it's a killerrepresentation to see who you rootingfor everyone in the NorthShore isprobably tuning in listening and that'sexciting exciting to see at least acommunity isnow represented in a a reallyinteresting way it's not complete but atleast everyone is at least one degree ofseparation between everyone here in thefinals well well said and one of thethings I reallyappreciate in getting to commentate withyou is your ability to really put intocontext the the working parts of whatculture looks like here in the islandsit's so easy to have a a a skewed pointof view from the outside looking in notreally understanding uh the culture andso I just appreciate all the differentmanners in which you're able to explainand and learn learn people if you willon on what it means and also so thatpeople can can when they come to theislands it strengthens their ability toshow the proper type of respect uh whenvisiting this incredible placewell we we appreciate this opportunityto have a celebration in this uhmakahiki season that we're in the timeofcelebrating agriculture fertility uhpeace but it's also a time to uhshowcasesportsmanship M Pang dropping intosomething that didn't quitematerialize uh in the Hawaiian culturetraditionally we have uh a 9monsemi 9month period of War season uhwhere the the chief Dums battle forum for Mana we call and that that worduh if those Surfers out there we talkabout this Mana Loosely translated thespiritual power uh but this Mana is thiskind of intangible thing that exists uhnot just in humans but in the waves inThe Reef in the wind in the rocks rocksand the trees it's something that istransferable and it's a feeling andthat's something that maybe peopledescribe when they come to these islandsthey feel this mana and this war timethese 9 months out of the year you'retrying to elevate your ability toacquire the most amount of Mana uhthrough uh war is one aspect that isallowed but in these 3 months ofmakahiki season which we're incurrently it's abouta different way to acquire Manasportsmanship a celebrating your valueum and these makahiki games were putforward where people would showcasetheir efforts and this is one expressiona modern day expression of that so we'revery fortunate tohave this opportunity Oh Billy keerremember Billy competing with thatbroken fifth metatarsel in his left footso every time he takes off on a wave hewants to he's doing the best he can tonot make thingsworse he justgets greeted if you will by thatwave where it's going to be no one'sgetting handed this final today whoeverwins thisis working forit as more sets out the bat comein see the hawaian water Patrol justcoming in to make sure that Billy's okayhaving a check on him as he is doing thehard yards rightnow H water Patrol a big Mahala to youfolks for keeping the competitorsafeand the Lifeguard norshore lifeguardAssociationCity and County PublicService the this wouldn't be possiblewithout you folks keeping e Wong safe uhemo zurac uh we had some spills heretoday and it's it's amazing to see thatwe have infrastructure here to supportsafety and also uh courses such as thebig wave risk assessment group The bragcommunity who is out there who Eli Alonagain who's been in many of theserescues has been he he first learned howto do rescue from the big wave risk thebigwave risk assessment group brag so thankyou for for the community giving thatinformation also to thecommunity and I love that you bring thatup as poor Billyjust doing doing the T yeah you see himwave away the ski though he said heyI'll paddle out I made that choiceI'll that's a billy esque and after hegets this through this one he should getpulled through the rip and not have toduck dive uh again but I love how youbring up uh that big wave riskassessment because for many years it wassort of loose like outside of thelifeguarding Community amongst big waveSurfers there wasn't necessarily a plantand afteryou know different incidents uh andinjuries Etc the Surfers coming togetherand being like okay we need to to toraise our Collective awareness of of oneanother each other as a collective inthese situations as we see MPang oh getting clipped um and it's beengreat to watch the way that has evolvednot just from the life- savingperspective but also in the work for allof these Surfers to to learn the breathwork do the underwater work uh whathappens in bad situations to to to equipmake sure that everyone is as fullyequipped as possible for this level ofSurfing the strategies aredefinitely not very clear out hereduring thisheat we have people waiting but we alsohave people so far uh seems like Sethdidn'ttry to grab something he's waitingtrying to be patient trying to pullfrom his hisfamily'sexperience son of legendarySurfer Uncle Tony monise seen lots ofshots of uh Tony mon on the beach allsmiles what a legend such a kind humanwhole family kind human but you knowUncle Tony he he had a work to get towhere he he is to be that Legend statushe's I always was pretty nervous aroundUncle Tony oh first time I met him Icouldn't even look him in the eye I wasjust like oh you're you're you're notjust in the movies yeah right I mean hehe had these pogs with he it was if yougot the Uncle Tony POG like I rememberhaving them and they were like gold tome I don't know I'm I'm I'm sure theyounger generation doesn't know whatpogs are but like bottle caps it's likeagame here's the the road to how our fourfinalists made it in and uh on dayone John John Florence was doing JohnJohn Florence things at pipeline wow itlook how perfect thatlooks can't believe that was the firstday but also Maka paying today doingwhat he had to do to get the final verysimilar to how kanana did last year inthe dire Heats of the day just stayingtrue holding his line and finding thosewaves gifted to him love that GoProperspective this was Billy keer caughtone wave in his first heat and he madeitcount yeah this was a awide tube that he just open up sayingyeah I have a broken foot opting to ridethe 68 instead of his normal 64 66 andSeth just doing the work getting reallyunderl riding a little bit longer boardbut navigating out through these barrelsthat wave wasinsane I mean that's that's what getsyou to the finals here being able tonavigate and for those who didn't watchthe entire contest and are just tuningin for the finals it was not easy uh wehad Heats during the rounds where therewas essentially zero waves the scoringpotential was non-existent like similarto this heat now we we're looking atthrees ones across the board Billy has aa combined score of half a point Makpang's wave that we we saw that was theonly wave of its kind that came in hisheat and he sees the opportunitywholly I mean this is going to be hectictowards but again these are these areall you have world champions in thisseat you have uh an insanely talentedpipeline specialist from Mak ping andyou have Seth mon who if we think backto that heat he had with KellySlater he he went toe-to-toe with a amulti- world champion multi-pipelineMaster Triple Crown winner and you knowSeth held his own in in a waythat he he held himself self in such ahigh regard and respect that you know itit couldn't go to a more deservingindividual right now if he were tomanifest a a wave outhere now that we're back in thisprioritysituation the stakes are the highestthat they've been the entire event weare we have the the the title The thatLegacy that lasts with you forever ofbeing a pipe Master $100,000 for firstprize um do Seth and John John you thinkhave more of an advantage when it comesto playing the strategy of priorityespecially in theseconditions mean I I would say they'recurrently most they're implementing thatstrategy on a more current basis rightnow by being a world championship tourSurfers uh Seth here taking off H notseeing good scoring potential on thatopting to bail out theback but again I'm not Idon't I mean it's obviously has to havesome sort of Advantage at a certainpointMakaoh kind of just roll the dice I guess Idon't know likewhat I don't know hard to tell what'sgoing on in the minds of theseindividuals right now none of themseeming to opt in to themic for their finalHeatI mean 16 minutes may seem like a longtime for us but I think this is going tofly by to these competitors we'rethere's only 16 minutes left in a finaland this is this is a 40-minute final a40 minute final we are 2/3 of the weightfinished withthis with no major scores on theboard What would you be doing if youwere out there Salma what would I bedoing that's hilarious if I was outthere if it was half the size it wasright nowum I don't know I mean oh there's somesets probably coming out the we can hearthebeach what would they be doing firstpriority is red second priority thisgeneration third priority blackpriority they're about to fire up theBarbie who who you think those guys arerootingfor MAA I mean they're that's that's theclosest to their age group I'm surethey're like oh maybe uncle John Johnmight bringing home Uncle Billy throwyourself in this heat right now with 14minutes to go and everything that wediscussed on the line what are youlookingfor I I can't even imagine even beingout there amongst these these Surfersbut if I was to in some alternateuniverse in space to be alongside ofthese amazing talented humans I probablywould be just sitting out the backwaiting for one wave something similarto getting an opportunity like whatHarry got or what bam got or you knowjust essentially what kais got you knowat this point um I I just Russell beybeylike at at a certain point these allthese all these guys want to win I'msure um like getting a sing we'regetting a good wave up P but four peopleout that could make your know make yourlife really I am wondering where ourprioritysituation is rightnow I know Seth is probably in the backof the pack I'm sure our production teamwill let us know I believe Seth was thelast person to go on awave you can really see that wind swellnow coming from the Northeast those ribsthat's the that's a surfaceswell getting a bit of surface currentpushing people down towards off the wallthat if you see they're continuouslypaddling and it's also pushing them inwhich youve seen a lot of surfers aregetting caught throughout the day it'sthey sit they think they're in the spotand this wind just kind of keeps pushingthem into the Impact Zone you're alwaysgot to think ahead and I'm sure that'sgoing through the minds of these theseSurfers okay how do I stay but all theseSurfers are from the generation ofsitting underneath the double up rightthe these aren't Rollin Specialists thatare also amazing incredible Surfers outat pipeline this is the crop of situnderneath it so they don't want topaddle too far out and they might beriding shorter boards to make sure theyJohnFlorence going around it reading it Imeanthere go he's that guy he is that guydid you see how he made sure once he sawthat first section wasn't going to offerhe's like all right I'm going to goaround this thing and maximize whateverpoints I can get yeah I mean he if youlook he didn't just pull off off thetakeoff into some crumbler he looked atit went around it waited to find thatBarrel again that's just experienceknowing okay at this time I got to getbusy I got to do something what if a setdoesn't come is it enough to win I don'tthink I don't know probably not Sethuh now here's a weird thing that I'mgoing to say it might be enough to wingiven given these conditions this allcomes on of that 45 on 45 off you knowwhat and if you you wonder now if hemight sit just a little bit more to thenorth and try to get some weird wide onethat comes underneath to Chuck in air doa couple ofturns and stay away from thepack oh and just like that oh John goingback doorher wow Imean this is just he he knows what he'sgot to do you know he's I laugh becausepeople forget like howtenacious of a comp like Fiercecompetitor John John is because he doesdoesn't wear it in his face he's notvocal with it but he's so so focused aswe saw him be like all right you guyspaddle back out I'm going to sit on theinside and back this thing up Mak paygoing in let's go driving driving ohfalling smoked at theend you can almost see maybe the yearsof experience in here you have Maka I'mgoing to go I'm going to catch all he heis the most waves caught so far um whichalso gives him the most potential to geta high score and then you have Johnrecognizing let me just put something onthe board this this format is what JNdoes for a living to win World titlesyeah and when when that's what you dofor a living like you saw it he just andyou're also the best in the world you dothis taking the lead with a12.5for his lastwave you know when you when you see thewaves that are coming in but you knowokay these smaller back door waves justget deep and getout he'sstoked Maka looking for better qualitywaves but a little bitimperfection ah I don't know whathappened there at that very end let'stake alook oh the see the foam ball justgobbled up hisboard waiting on the scores forMaka as JN paddles back out I think nowhe's thinking okay now maybe wait for agood a good wave you know just strategywhere he can be patient wait forsomething big andweird knowing that he's put pressure onon the rest of the field to get twowaves yeah remember for the last threedays three rounds excuse me it's beenyou know I can get a wave here a wavethere now we're back to like you got tostack thesetwo you know but you can't count outanybody in this moment a single wave asingle mediocre wave will Propel any oneof these competitors into the topSE into the mix but now John is atcombined 30 we're looking at 18 and a12 eight minutes to go ifyou're if your yourBilly Sethor or Maka you you need to get one underyour belt a decent one under your beltand I think John just put the pressureon them saying you guys now need inreality one amazing wave in theexcellent range or two good wavesthat isn't just like oh maybe I'll catchtwo small ones like I'm sure there's aprocess that John goes home with alittle notebook and paper and writesdown okay say this scenario happens orat least might talk through it with oneof his coaches to say okay what is thestrategy in this event this scenariohappens what should I do and you know nodoubt these drilled this a thousandtimes he had this heat already before ithappened you know this is just onevariation potentially and this is allspeculating cuz I don't really know howfreakish he is in all this stuff but Icould imagine and I wouldn't besurprised because you kind of people whoare successful in their life they dothis in whatever profession or path theychoose they have multiple scenarios thatthey have planned out and they wait foreach oneto present itself and then they executeMak M he's just going big on these closeouts he's trying to securesomething well you said it before you'llsee the difference inenergy from that sort of measuredcalculated to M just being like I'mgoing to throw myself over as many ofthese things as possible and I'm goingto I'm going to get thatwave you know the you can feel the T thetension pull inas why is Billy and Seth their game planmust be we're waiting for good ones soyou if that situation happens again wedon't have the priority in front of usso we don't really know how thisstrategy is really playingout you see when the that's spray comingoff the lip you able to see that thatwind in real time yeah that's the windthat's moving now more from the norththan from the East the the pristineconditions out here at this coast alongthe NorthShore are south east Southeastwinds uh this is coming from theNortheast um we seewinners battling out through the windfirst place 100,000second place $75,000 for second placethat's yeah we talk about that hungerGrand the whole time but that's 75 forsecond 50 for third and 25 for fourthall strong differen makingfunds in a professional surfer's life ofcourse John John the onlyformer pipe master in thisfield seems they're now all clumpedtogether out there with Billy trying toseparate himself from the pack and maybeSeth following him abit 5 minutes left wow this ishow I demand a recounthow it's going by so fast and again withthe that's another thing that you knowJohn is aware of with that clockmanagement getting those twoscores they're now competing against hisscores and against the clock as wewelcome in our contest director NathanFletcher congratulations on a great daymaking that calltoday thank youSalma what was it what was it like whenyou were waking up this morning and itit looked like there was no waves andpeople are chirping in your ear sayingthings and deciding to run and it endedup being high action all throughout theday yeah yeah well today we definitelyum looked at the forecast much as youknow as much as we could to reallypredict what was coming in the futureand what was happening and so wedefinitely were checking the buoys allnight and then it came down to uh youknow Jody young and myself and the Vansguys talking about how we could uhmodify the competition and shave twominutes off of each heat which got us Ithink it was a half an hour of time andthen to the 40-minute final to where wecan complete the whole contest todaybecause the forecast looks prettyhorrendous really North Northeast swelldefinitely size but uh as we've seen itchange today you know just throughoutthe day you've seen the swell definitelygo from West and nice to north um and sowe are really crunched to get the bestconditions we could and that's why wehad the day the other day where itwasn't quite the ultimate pipe day butin my opinion in2023 to be a true pipe Master you haveto be able to surf six to eight foot youhave to be able to pull out your smallboards and then surf to 2 to 4 foot forairs and whatever and that's why we sawJohn John really perform in thoseconditions and then I actually I washoping I'd be a little bit bigger todayum in this evening cuz we had a prettysolid buoy reading this morning I thinkit was uh 16 ft at 18 seconds but Ithink the wind in the swell Directionreally blew it down between here andKawai and so ultimately we had greatconditions we had small conditions andthen we had the rising swell today andthen all your scores are scratched andso then the four pipe uh finaliststhey're going to have to surf in maxingPipeline and so I was thinking in myhead that's really what you want to be apipe Master is be able to perform andcontest in all the conditions and thenyou have big maxing pipe for the finalyeah I mean you said it best you knowJohn John really able to Showcase thaton both days and even in an unlikely uhscenario and Billy keer he he surfedreally really solid on the smaller dayum did some really great turns uh atback door and put himself position toget the score that he needed today asdropping in isBilly yeah Billy that's going to be theend of hiscampaign well Billy really performed onthe small day as well and I think peoplewere taking it as a throwaway day but inour heads we really didn't want to haveit be a two- round competition which wehad to condition based last uh year andso you saw the guys who took the smalldays seriously where they're in thefinal and that was that's really whatmakes a pipe Master is being able to umyou know serve all the different facesof Pipeline and not just 10t perfectPipeline and uh another thing I want toreally note is I'd really like to thankVans for you know funding thiscompetition promoting this competitionputting their neck on the line andchanging the format for progression youknow for really the Surfers and thenalso the sport in progressing the sportbut that's also better for thespectators and so you know in in my headthat's a that's a big bold maneuver andyou know they're really funding theculture of Pipeline and what's new andwhat's to come and you know like peoplehave said before but my brother wasreally at the Forefront of gettingbarreled and doing aors and surfingpipeline at this this style of Surfingand so I've been seeing this you knowmost of my life and I was part of it andso it's really really cool to see youknow where the future of the sport is atthe moment and where that'll take usbecause we don't know what the future isbut but we have seen it change a lotsince I was a kid and and I've been onthis beach you know for 40 plus yearsand I've seen a lot of people come andgo I've seen you know multiple peopledie multiple people getresuscitated and you know this is like Isaid before too this is dreams becomereality and also you know there'scertain cases where dreams get brokenand you go home in an ambulance soJohn's the new pipe Masterschampion and I don't think it could goto a better guy you see thatsmile you see that smile as Billy's pingover to congratulate him an incredibleperformancebyI the best in the world at this momentall around for me uh for John John andhe but he's so modest and so humble andin in his calculation of of and knowingwhat it would have mean uh to to winthis event and he never ever made itseem like it was a shoe in in any wayshape or form his brothers took it tohim as hard as they could and pushed himand um John John Florencejoining Moana JWang as our men's and women's respective2023 buam pipe Masters we're going tosend Dr Clifford Kono down to this tothe stage as he's going to host theceremony I got to say you know what awin that must feel really good forJohn um he's definitely in a differentspot in his life congratulations on himgoing to be a father at some point soonand I feel like he took it as serious ashe takes anything in his life thisdefinitely wasn't just a hand me downyeah it it wasn't just a happy to behere no he he brought his aame and itreally showed and he's getting walked upthe beach by his brothers kanakaSolutions and this is definitely one forthe record books and that's anotherthing too is Moana Jones W she took itto pipeline like no other uh female hasever taken it toPipeline and uh you know to see thoseperformances it's definitely part ofhistory and something that I was reallyhappy to be here to see I was happy tomake the calls I tried my hardest did mybest and I feel like uh the callprevailed today and it's not always thatwayso well for all the times that uh youknow the the call didn't go your waythis absolves all of that I mean this isyou couldn't ask for more and this istruly you know this is this is an eventthat I believe we'll look back it's likeoh this was a shift this was this was adisruptive shift in what the future uhcan look like especially in what it'sdone for women atpipeline it's second to none for thewomen at pipeline I feel like they'rejust getting started and also too I alsofeel that you knowuh it's the most captivating to theaudience to see stuff that people havenever done and I feel like really youknow all the women all theirperformances you know that's that's newthat's never been done and there's thosethree look at the littleMusketeers I love it man I love the waythey've been having fun on social mediawith their theirbeards and you know they they're all forone and one for all but but UniqueIndividuals at Le as well within thesport and it's perfect day and how aboutthis crowd on aTuesday on a Tuesday you know the onefunny thing is is you'll probably seeIvan at the skate park today after thecontest because he is definitely put histime in at the skatepark and I feel like pipeline the skatepark the school across the street theseguys arehomegrown 100% this is their backyardand it really really proves that youknow time put in time really pays offand I feel like John doesn't know whatto do right now he's so happy just to gohome and relax afterthis well we'll find out what what he'sgoing to do where his mind's at cuz he'swith Holly right now uh yeah John Johnjust came in from his second surf everat pipeline uh how's that feel it feelsso good to those ones are so hard thosetypes of Heats when it's just there'snot a lot of good waves um it's a grindyheat so it feels good to win it but wastough I wanted to have a good battlewith everyone and just the right wavesdidn't come yeah but I'm so I was sogood to watch congratulations thank youfantastic thanyou the smile says it all andum I'm sure Mama Florence right now issmiling really big Imean the the manner in which shehelped to set the path for for theseboys from the time that they were yayhigh to to say this this this is yourlife she really put him here like therewas this was Destiny and it's funnybecause she almost knew that it wouldhappen but you could never know but Iremember watching John John when he wasjust a little kid and and you reallyknew you could see the difference in hissurfing and then there was a littleperiod when he is about 14 or 15 wherepeople speculated this and that and Iremember going on a boat trip with himand he was a little guy and then thenext year we went on the boat trip and Iwas he was 16 and once he turned 16 youknew that he was going to be the best inthe world yeah for for a kid to be sortof ordained at a very very young age asthe the second coming of Kelly Slater umto be mentioned in in the in the sameranks as as Andy and Tom Cur and Etc tobe on the cover of of Surfer magazine at12 years old that's a lot to live up toand a lot to live up to especiallycoming from such a small island and whathe's done with it with each time he'scontinued to fulfill another prophecy ithasn't shaken him he's he's had thisability to stay centered um despite allthe we didn't even talked about all theinjuries that he's gone through thatcould have ended his career uh it it'sit's it's just great to watch and seewhere he's at yeah I really feel thatJon's going to uh continue like this ishis life this is his path but right nowI feel like he's just getting his stridehe's a real man and what I've noticed islike 30 to 40 you're in your Prime it'snot you know everybody thinks oh you'rein your Prime and at 18 to 25 but uh ifyou take care of yourself and you tryhard and work hard and with his naturalability I feel like we're going to seesome strong performances you know fromJohn and from 30 to 40 I feel like he'sjust getting to know himself and knowwhat he likes he's coming into his ownand he's strong enough and educatedenough to really take advantage of thesenext couple years yeah and you know hehe becoming a two-time pipe Master todayRoy Russell Derek Ho and now you can addJohn John Florence to that list of oftwo-time pipe Masters that's and alongwith Milana she's a two-time pipe masterand we also had Rory here today who is atwo-time pipe master and I feel like oneis something but when you do two itreally your spot is like a true pipeMaster indeed it does it it has been anincredible 3 days I think they arewaiting for you me on the beach oh I'mout yeah we love you slma I love you ohyou're staying Holly you're wrong Hollycame in here and tried to Holly came inand uh almost uh she almost threw thethe the post show she tried to stealyour company I was I'm not doing this bymyself well let's uh take a look at howthis thing all startedhuh this morning you made the choice totrust thebuoys I did make the choice to trust thebuoys and I also made the choice uh onthe forecast as far as you know lookingto see in the future and what thecapabilities were of maybe having allwomen in a women's final today and thengoing into men another day with a men'sfinal but that just really wasn't anoption I felt you know with theconditions we had all the way up toHarry Bryan's wave was phenomenalpipeline it definitely got tricky lateron but you can't control the weather andyou know you can't control the forecastso we did our best we tried to geteverybody out there and as good as andMoana is just an absolute Beast I got totell you I mean you can see that this isbefore the sun has fully come up shortlybefore this maybe an hour before this itwas flat it was flat but you knew it wascoming because those buoys they tend tonot lie and you can really try you knowforecasting when it's a week out that'sjust all speculation until it gets to beabout 2 days away once the wind hits thewater you have a much better idea ofwhat's going to happen and then thewaves hit the buoy and when you when ithits the buoy you reallyknow that was the the Emi wave at backdoor and it was just a festival allday that was one of my favorite waveswas rayaru and you know he was rightthere he just didn't get the exit butthe drop and the commitment and thenHarry's wave right there oh the first 10rayar's wave probably would have been a10 as well but that that Harry Bryantwave was insane the foone ball lookedlike it wasCGI he's really had uh I mean just a Idon't know a string of luck or justDestiny but with his back door wave lastyear where he got that huge back doorone and then he he's like the slowcreeper guy to where it was like thirdround he got the 10 um but I feel likethose are two of the best waves of hislife at pipeline 100% and they both camein this contest and I don't think heexpected it but uh you know it's it wasNature's order it just gave it to himand uh I'm sure he couldn't be happierfor sure uh this wasalso a pipe Masters in which people hadto work and and pipeline flexed you knowwe saw a lot of people uh going over thefalls we had a couple of injuries as wewere aware ofbut in order to be great at pipeline youhave to pay the tax and there's a largetax to pay I don't know if it's 7 or 10%over here you know what I mean but andthat's what we were saying too thelineup's not regulated anymore and it'snot in a contest but pipeline regulatesyou know what I mean the wave does theregulating it just picks you and so asmany times have you surfed it uh that'sjust more the odds of the chance thatyou're leaving in an ambulance and it'sreally not bad until you leave in anambulance and you know those times andit's it's it's different than justgetting a little bang or bump FrankieHerer had somehow had two of those umthere's Ava Wong U that she was beingtended to at the beach and they ended uptaking her to the hospital for furtherevaluation to make sure she was okayBethany Hamilton was just chargingsending herself out over wave after wavethis too you can see that the swell isrising and it was really jacking and uhit was really hard to make it down theface at that point and uh theydefinitely were going as hard as theycould go and it was amazing more peopledidn't get hurt in my opinion yeah sothis is definitely the Highlight uhWipeout reel 24wipeouts uh total uh with Amo zurac alsotaking a trip to the hospital we we wishhim uh and Ava both uh a quick recoveryand right now I believe we are going togo out to the main stage and uh hand outsome some beautiful trophies and somechecks and Crown someChampions and those are some HappyCamp all right Aloha everybodyaloh[Music]uh big

and try as hard as theycould and really um solidifying theirdominance at pipeline yeah and again asas as John pointed out not in idealconditions and you could there'ssometimes in in some sports right wherethings aren't going uh a competitor'sway or the field conditions whateverpeople people might take a play off orjust say like whatever I'm over it youdidn't see that energy at all today asthe conditions deteriorated theseSurfers only threw themselves more inthe Harm's Way challenged themselvestrying to to to do their best they couldto move forward in this event and thatto me was it was it was the heart and Ialso thinklike the appreciating and belief of whatthis particular event means definitelyand what I really saw was uh you knowthe first two rounds were not laxed butbecause of this format people were kindof surfing at a level and but man oncethat third day started the excitementand the energy and really it just hadsuch a different uh feel to it today Ireally feel like people came and reallygave it their all today there was no uhyou know no slacking in effort and andtoday was something different once thethird round started you really saw theguns come out it wasn't a joke todayyeah I don't I don't even think it was ajoke before I think it was just there'sthe the format breeds a little bit morehappy gol lucky right it does and thenbut man the third round there was nothappy gol lucky all that was out thewindow and you saw the leaderboardchange so many times today where extingyeah you saw people just see it in theireyes to be able to get onto theleaderboard even if they are seventh oreighth or whatever all they needed theywere calculating scores they werewatching Heats and it was a littledifferent vibe today than the uh lastcouple days which I really I really liketo see so some contests it's a leadup tothat you know you get to the semis andbut you're already out yeah you know insenses but this it's like your your yourlast Heat is like that's your go youcould pull it out you could pull out youknow 230s or something and go all theway from the bottom onto the leaderboardI think Billy keer did a prettyoutstanding job at that I agree I agreeand the women really setting the tonethis morning not just for the event butalso for the future of what women'ssurfing looks like atpipeline an interesting one that I sawtoo was Mikey February started with alead and then he didn't get much wavesand he was just dangling in fourth andthen it was just like oh it was a matterof time but this wave here from MoanaJones Wong sort of set the tone whereshe was really starting to feel it uhCarissa showing that all this extra timeChris Moore has put put in at pipelinecounting Molly picklum I mean herperformance her backhand attack and whatshe's done in the last year incrediblemy favorite part about uh Molly too wasshe didn't just get barreled she cameout and slammed the lift with like youknow I want to say pure aggression butshe didn't let anything go towaste AaronBrooks definitely put on the show 16yearsold just weaving andthreading yeah this angle I really likeright here you could see her smiling inthebarrel Moana Jones Wong just having allof thefun and she said you know she reallyfelt like the waves that she wanted cameto her it was funny the way theconditions kind of changed after herheat too it was like uh and alsostarting with the uh the coin toss towhere you know there was a littleblunder there but she didn't want to goin this seat and she wanted to be atthis time and you know all that stuffreally worked in her favor in the endyeah the Queen the queen she reallylived up to that today amazing it wasamazing to be down on the beach you canfeel the energy people were freaking outdown there I was like oh trying to do mybest

the line andlike I said before you really don't knowwhat a real wipe out is or a realpipeline beating until you're leaving anambulance that really changes the toneand not not to mention the PTSDafterwards and trying to get back on thehorse right John John really showing hislocal knowledge as well as his yearsyears and years of how to grind througha heat as after that pipeline wave hesat just inside and said let me seewhat's on offer here and stay away fromthe pack out thislittle back doorRunner he kind of played that perfectbecause he got the left which was ascore but then he got the

Gold and he no when he did catchthat waveno inflation vest at the time doing anold school style which is uh which isgoing to be rare because as our safetyprotocol and Equipment has evolvedyou'll see a number of our Surfers bothwith static built-in uh padding andinflation uh flotation as well asinflation those inflation vests cruisingthrough the lineup herewe'll look to out there in the purplejerseyis Greg Long Greg Long the 2009 Eddiechamp out of San Clemente California 39years old Greg's going to be one of theveterans out in the lineup yeah Greg hasbeen you know Greg and his

as well as a two-timeWorld Champ John John Florence you gottaask you gotta think he's gonna be one ofthe favorites in this year's event yeahJon Jones known as the guy that makesbig and scary waves look reallycomfortable the way that he rides themhe's definitely comfortable out here andI mean he's one of the favorites forsurewaves crashing through there and Surfersstill anticipating larger sets sitting alittle bit further out of the brake lineas we fly by here high up abovebeautiful morning here at Waimealooking to round off our heat out therein the white jerseythe goofy footKOA Rothman is going to be out there 29years old this is called a second Eddieand he comes from a prestigious surfingfamily cause brother mccookai is goingto be in the competition later todaycall his father Eddie

andFiji and all around the world he's alsoan expert at pipeline where justrecently he won the best wave of thecompetition at the Huey backdoorshootout so Cole Rothman is definitely acharger what's cool too is him and JohnJohn grew up together so really closefriends out there in the water todayanother goofy foot on the water markHealey in the orange Jersey Mark Healy41 years old this is healy's fourthEddie Mark made a bit of surf historyyears back at the Eddie taking a couplelefts out here at ymail which is prettyunorthodox yeah I mean Mark Healey isknown as the guy that is fearless and ithas trained for for years on even withas a free diver and he knows how to holdhis breath here we go John John Florenceis going to start off the day just alittle test away for Florence and cutsgets caught up in the Whitewater divesoff so that's gonna be our first scoreof the morning when we look at scores inthe format of this year's Eddie big waveInvitational in memory of Eddie Aikau weare using a one to ten point scalefor each of the rides with half a pointoptions so keeping it nice and cleanthere you either got a point a 0.5 twopoints all the way up till 10 and that'show we're gonna do our scoring Isaiahyeah then John John we'll see uh howthat went I think you're right kite wellI was just kind of getting in his feetin the wax I suppose andboth John's aren't kind of cool thathe's the first one to start us off inthe morning so he'll be getting outthere looking for some bigger rideswe were rounding off our heat and wehave yet two competitors to ID out thereas we take a look here dropping in Intothe Blue Jerseybearing gold it looks like it could verylook like very much like Shane Dorianout there who's in the actual blackJersey Shane Dorian he's the veteran ofThis Crew 50 years old he's been arunner-up here before waves in the backand two goofy foots up there so whitethat would be KOA Rothman as well asorange as Mark Healey we're just talkingabout Mark so we got some scores on theboardyeah one thing unique too about thisevent you wouldn't normally see peoplesharing the same wave but at Waimea Benat the Eddie I call it is allowed yes aslong as so there is an interference butyou'd have to blatantly get uh insomeone's in someone's way so we'll getwe'll get to that as we go over ourrules but there's options ofinterference if you do hinder someone'sline uh out there but that one lookedclean between Mark Healey as well asCarl Rothman we saw Shane Dorian andhe's 50 years old out of Hawaii Islandthis is Shane's sixth Eddie and Shane uhwas a runner-up in 2001 to Ross ClarkJones a 2001 champ out here uh two timesthird place finish that was 2004 as wellas 2016 for Shane Dorian could this beShane's year we'll start off with thereplay Isaiah this is John John I cansee a very tall wave it's got a littlebit of that morning warble to it whichmay have contributed to that fall at theend but beautiful Drop nonethelessthat's another angle beautiful droneangle shot and this was the one of ShaneDorian a late takeoff goes behind theboil there you can seemanages to get through that section ofwhitewash exploding behind himand he rides out of it which is great tohave a successful ride through thatexploding section of Whitewater gettingthrough some of the bump and chop fromthis morning sometimes on the NorthShore we call them morning sicknessbehind them we have the two goofyFooters Mark Healy and Cole Rothmanjust a quick drop and out for KOA andMark riding this wave a little furtherlooks like John John paddling for thisonethis is a different way of drops in youcan see behind that boil as well takes abottom turn rides through this see if hecan get through that whitewash and hedoesso John John Florence already with twowaves ridden again a reminder after yourfourth wave you gotta paddle in that'sall you're going to get but John John isquick to strike out here and we're goingto see uh how the the scores comethroughyeah so beautiful morning here in Hawaiiand at Waimea Valley and Waimea Bay andfortunate here to be able to watch thesegreat Surfers in this heatwell let's talk a little bit aboutWaimea Isaiah's but first let's talkabout John John on his second wavebeautiful wave drops in behind thatsectionexplosion behind him which contributesto the uh and the excitement of thiswave manages to get around thatwhitewashsee how deep he is on this wavereally makes for higher scoring pointsif you're behind that wave as you'redropping in and are able to ride throughthat section that is in front of youcriteria yeah so Waimea Bay is part ofthe ahupua of of Waimea Valley and ampuais basically a villager Community that'scentered around a riverand it's known as the one of theLuscious and most fruitful communitiesespecially even in Old Hawaiiit's also seen as a center for Hawaiianculture even todaybut particularly it was seen as aspiritual center in times of old whereHigh priests like high priests have ahevawho is kamehameha's high priest orKahuna Nui and he resided over this areaof of Waimea ValleyRyder here dropping in it looks likeit's going to be blue and that's AaronGoldall right there's a little frothy onewhich in surfing refers and there's alot of foam on the face of the wavewhich is the result of the previouswaves that broke in front of it thosecan often be challenging to to navigateand bear with us as we go and try to IDsome of these Surfers we're looking forinformation from the beach to make surethat we have because we start we have 40in invitees butwe do have an incredible alternate listof surfers so there may be somesubstitutions in this in these Heats andumtrying to find out exactly who's out inthe water is going to be key we're goingto be iding them out of just surfingstyle here's a style right here with inblueyeah again you can see the surfer wasable to get around that it was tricky toget around through the foamy section youcan see it here as wellyeah I do believe that's Aaron Goldso we got some some scoring done we'llupdate you on the standings this is thefirst heat of the morning 45 minuteHeats in this round number one fiveHeats in this first round ofI would say spiritual competition in away Isaiah because this is unlike anyother contest uh in the worldyeah and that that really attributes tothe to the attributes of Waimea Valleyand Waimea Bay there's a lot of inHawaii we call Mana and Mana it's kindof like this energy this spiritualenergy that that accompanies the thewriters and the um the islands in theocean and Waimea Valley is definitely apart of that tradition of carrying a lotof ManaI think this is Andrea Moellersir Andrea Mueller on her first wave anduh is going to go complete on thatand so completes the ride and there yougo well history made the first waveridden by a woman in competition here atthe EddieI think it's only fitting becausetraditionally in Hawaiian Societywomen were very active in all of theHawaiian word for surfing and so I thinkit's beautiful to have so many wahine orwomen in our event this year at the yetia little more replay of Andreayeah you see you're dropping down thereand was able to make this wave a tallwave not the biggest wave of the heatbut nonetheless successfully written andshe'll be out there still has three morewaves to catchyeah as we mentioned before AndrewMuller she's a a great Surfer as well asa world-class paddler has set a a lot ofRecords a lot of wins both a stand-uppaddling prone paddling canoe paddlingboth in a one-person canoe as well as acrewand has also written some big big wavesum at jaws andin the tow Arena as well rightand you'll hear a lot of we've talkedabout 88 Kyle that he was a watermanWaterman water Woman these terms reallyshow that that an individual who has adiverse ability in the ocean whetherit's paddling canoes surfing big wavesdiving fishing a variety of differentthings so it's really cool that Andreacomes from a real diverse background ofriding different watercrafts and beingan athlete and so I know she's she's setsome records for crossing channelsbetween islands as a paddler and so it'sdefinitely someone who's familiar withthe power of the Mana of the oceanI was talking about Waimea Valleypreviously and how it was known as kindof a spiritual center in times of oldand one of the high Priests ofKamehameha have a hevato make a connection with uh Eddie Aikauhave have us also the ancestor to theicons to Eddie Aikau and his familyand so there's a really cool connectionand spiritual vibe that brings us rightto the Aikau familyEmily Erickson she's on her way outshe'll be in pink in the nextheat and Emmy EricksonDad Roger was a great big Wave Rider andEmmy Erickson out there taking out aSingle Fin a Kyle Larson 10-6 that's herOld Faithful you could see it beingrepaired over and over again we talkabout Mana there's a connection betweenEmmy and that board and it's evidentthat that's her you know her go-to forbig waves yeah a lot of times people sayyou have your favorite board or yourmagic board you put it on ice or have itsit on the side but looks like she's puta lot of time into that board and uhevidenced in some of the repairs thatare that are fixed on it but lookingforward to watching her out hereyeah it looks like she's got some abrace on the knee so and that's going tobe a story uh going throughout today inthat we have a number of invitationSurfers that have been invitedcompetitors that will be surfing withinjuries because it's so it's soprestigious to be in just invitedto this gathering this competition thiscelebration of Eddie Aikau thata lot of these men and women will not donot want to give up that opportunity andwe're going to see a lot of surfersout there taped up braced up ready to goyou know regardless because the bay iscalling the day today and they'reshowing upyeah these athletes are are Chargers inother words they surf a lot of dangerouswaves and because of that uh it'soften time that they'll they'll suffersome injuries but hopefully everyone ishealthy and we pray for everyone'swell-being today in the water becausethese waves are are beautiful and fun towatch but at the same time incrediblydangerousforeignin the purple jersey as we said beforehe's a former champ 2009 Greg Long tooka big win hereat the Eddy and really put him on thespotlight of global big wave surfingtaking out Kelly Slater that year whowas in the lead throughout most of theevent and Greg Long coming through inthat final heat of the day and snatchingthat Victory it would have been thesecond for Kelly Slater of course Slatera champ here back in 2002yeah and he really solidified it likeyou said at the end of the day and Iremember that massive one it was his hisbest wave of the day where it lookedlike the section was just closing out infront of him took a really late drop andwas rewarded for his courageous uhcharging of that massive waveout there in the black Jersey we talkeda little bit more about Shane Dorian andhis history here680i cows so Shane's actually one of theveterans in this year's competitionShane's been through and surfed withdifferent generation of Waimea Surfershe's going to see the Young Guns rightnow but Shane's was surfing with Clydecow Clyde ikau winning this eventyounger brother of Idiot won this eventin 1986. correct Shane was surfing withkeoni Downing who is a legend in surfingas as well as keoni's Dad George whoused to be the event director for theEddie keone winning in 1990 rightShane was surfing in 1999 when a youngNorth Shore Surfer made a big name forhimself Noah Johnsonyeah it was cool because um I mean NoahJohnson originally also from Big Islandfrom Hilo and so it's really cool thatuh 1999 you know I was able to get outthere and I remember Shane doe I meanShane doe and I also grew up on the bigisland and he he would fly over herewhen he was young and surf Waimea Bayfrom a young age from his uh high schoolyears and so Shane door is definitelynot a stranger to big waves there'smakuokai Rothman with the brace on hisknee we talked about these Warriorssurfing through injuries because it's soprestigious to be a part of this eventoh makua has a badly engineered I thinkit's an ACL or MCL I mean he's going tohave to go and and get get some workdone on it I talked to McCoy he said heyI'm not going to miss this for anythinghe may have a leash attached to a vestrather than his leg so he's not gettingget pulled on that bad knee or makuaalso told me heyI may not even wear a leash because if Ifall I'm not going to win and I I lovethat kind of spiritwas injured at the backdoor shootoutrecently it had to be carried off thebeach and soI'm also surprised that he's going forit because we've hit you know his kneeinjury was pretty pretty bad uh but wesee that like you're saying kaipo thatkind of warrior spirit I remember at the220 uh 2016 event Uncle clydecodislocated his shoulder during thecompetitionthey reset it on the beach he paddledback out and continued surfingthroughout the event so Warriors indeedare in this eventand it's shaping up to be a beautifulday Isaiah in that we havesome light winds we have a little bit ofhaze right now variable conditions

so we'llsee it was a black or perhapsumthat blue of Aaron Gold here we got toget an ID and it looks like it's it wasforeigngold on on that deep one on the paddleback outyeah look like oh you know what actuallyI take that backcould be Greg Long on his opening waveyeah it looked like we had two Riders onthat wave one deeper into the wave whichmeans it's closer to the to the peak ofthe wave or behind the peak of the waveand then another Rider that was sittinga little further on the end or what wesometimes called the shoulder of thewaveso we'll be able to ID that soonlines coming through here on thebuilding swelland we were talking a little bit aboutthe history of ymail what abouttalking about the great service thatEddie ikau brought to the community outhere on the North Shore not just anincredible Surfer but also the NorthShore's first lifeguard saving hundredsof lives in his career yeah he saidunder his watch and he didn't lose onepersonas a lifeguard at Waimea Bay in fact hewas also the first lifeguard to to bestationed at Waimea Bay because it wassuch a dangerous place that you knowthey they were worried that uhlifeguards would be liable and it wouldbe too much to handle sobecomes the first lifeguard at WaimeaBay in the1967-68 uh winter seasonand is known for being a quiet gentlemanactually but very prominently active insaving lives and rescuing people at thebay here at Waimea so the paddle backout there as we get this drone shot wecan see the blue jersey that would havebeen Aaron Gold on that wavesagain 45 minutes in this round one foreach of the Heats we're going to addfive minutes for round number two thisafternoon as we anticipate the swell tocontinue to build here at Waimeaand thank you for joining us here onSurfline as well as on K High For Thislive broadcast of the 10th running ofthe Eddiesecond wave in the set and a big wall ofwater Isaiah and this Surfers are gonnahave to make a decision right now longwall stretching out in front you can seethe boil there evident we'll see if wehave any takers on this first wave ofthe set oh my goodness that is a bombthat's a good sign this well is rapidlyrising and that was a significant waveyou could see it Barrel on the on thatsection and maybe the Surfers weren't inposition or there was too much watermoving up the face but that wave wasincrediblelaunching it to this oneand grabbing the rail through the insidethere that is Mark Healey in the orangeJerseyand Healy gets exploded but I love thego forward attitude of Mark HealeywowHealy no problemtakes the beating right back on to hisboardMark Healey one of the uh an incrediblefree diver and hasoutstandingbreath holding technique so this is aguy that can stay on the water for fourminutes right he'd have these trainingvideos actually of trying to show peoplehow to do it and the way that hecontorts his body and keeps that air inhis chest here we have a replayoh straightening out there that waspurple so that was Greg Longgetting to some of these replays AaronGold that's why he was paddling back outhe had to ditch the board thereand a little leash test for Aaron Goldand here we go with Mark Healey yeahthis is that last little Mark Healeythat one barrels behind him he grabs therail to the bottom turnso that would be one of his better wavesfor this heat so far and again ourSurfers are allowed to catch four waveswhich is unique to other competitionsand they have to be selective in whichwaves they choose to go onthat's right so two rounds four wavesallowed to be caught in each round topthree waves are going to be what aretally together for your place on theleaderboard and the crowd is one thingthat we always expect here at the baywhen the Eddie runs yeah apparentlypeople come down Camp here before hoursif not days before to make sure thatthey're here to watch this actionand it's exciting that it that the eventwas held this doesn't happen quite oftenin fact usually it's about every everydecade you'll have the event three timesuh about on average about three times wedid find that interestingly with umbetween the years of 1999 and 2009 that10-year period it was held five timeswhich is pretty unusual uh in comparisonso we haven't had the event since 2016and so we're excited to be here todayseven years later that's right here wego another set coming through and notakers on this one maybe a little paddleon the shoulderlooks like Andrea Moellerand Mueller getting another wave andcollecting some points for that oneyeah that was a hot streak from a1999-2001 and 2002back to back to back years running theEddy but that was very unusual becausethe bay calls the day right Isaiah itneeds to be 20 foot plusand peaking during the daylight hours sothat's one of the caveats that really uhcomes into play rightthis is so this is in the corner andthis is where our Surfers will launchinto the shore breakand to begin their paddle out trying toutilize the currents right Isaiahcorrect now the current will pull fromthe right side of your screen to theleft side of your screen once they geton the water they need to time thispaddle out because with that currentpulling you have a chance of gettingpulled all the way to the other side ofthe bay into the Rocks if you don't hitthat window and hit that channel so justgetting out to the lineupis a contest in itself yeah it is andyou especially don't want to make yourway too far to the to the West End ofthe beach or like you said where the bigrocks are but also the shore break thereis crazythere's a replay there of Andrea Mohlerit's a quick up and outit's great I think this is her second oreven third wave so she's staying activeand I'm sure she's ecstatic to be aparticipant in this year's Eddie bigwave Invitational in memory of EddieAikauyeah we were talking about the the Runof events from 1999 when Noah Johnsonwon two years later 2001 When Ross ClarkJones and then two then the next yearthere in 2002 and Kelly won and then2004 Bruce iron so that was a real likesolid run of of event and uhso that's a little unusual like you weresaying kaipo to have that many in adrove but we're excited that we're backhere in 2023 yeah and we do have alittle piece on Bruce irons we're goingto play that for you at some point inthe in the uh in the broadcast today andlook back uh at the win for Bruce ironsthat was in 2004 when Bruce was able totake out this prestigious title anotherguy who's got that prestigious trophy onhis mantles on your screen right therethere's a two-time World Champ John JohnFlorence our 2016 Champion butBruce irons reallyum innovated the way to surfing incompetition he took it all the waythrough the shorebreak let's learn moreabout Bruce science as Bruce irons looksback at his win in 2004. that was myfirst heat and that was uh that wasactually the last wave I could catch anduh the waves were peaking right thereyou know and uh Kelly was in my heat anduh I think Ross Williams and these hugeyou see the lines coming and I was likeoh here it comes you know and I remembereveryone kind of started piling out andI kind of just held a little bit lessthan they did you know like they allwent like 10 or 15 feet out and I wasI didn't want to get stuck on the top ofthe wave you know so I was like I'mgoing to stay right here and that wavecame and it was it was it was a big waveand uh Kelly was right out for me on theside and I wasand I was already in my rage and I was Iwas going to go no matter what[Music]it was my last wave so I was gonna rideit as far as I could to the beachbecause that was it and you know that inbetween stage it's just like this longsailing like you can hear thecommentator and I could hear the crowdand he's like oh is he getting anothershort break and on my mind I wasn'tthinking about that yeah it ended upcoming to the inside and you know justpulled in that close out and just gotblown up the beach and walked right tothe shower it was like it was as perfectas it could have got for me you know[Music][Applause]foreign[Applause]s from the years here at the Eddie bigwave InvitationalBruce irons Isaiah taking it all the wayto the shore break and a win yeah that'sShowmanship at its finest and we'retalking earlier about the competitorsright now that are making their waythrough that lineup they're trying toavoid that short break and normallythat's what you want to do but Bruceyounger brother of Andy Ironsin 2004 really took the Spotlight by uhputting an exclamation point on hisvictory by pulling into a massivecloseout shore break wave at here atWaimea Bayyeah that was uh an incredible momentlook at the lines that we got on ourscreen right now goodness more setsstacking upand gonna be hitting the peak here atWaimea competitors all in a packholding their positions and I'm sure theWaimea Surfers say that this is thetoughest part to do is just to hold theline you want to scratch for the Horizonbut if you do you're not going to be inposition to Catch the Wave first wavejust the indicator on this set and lookat all the lines we're going to see somedecisions and some positioning right nowit's amazing if you're not aware when wesay the set he's coming there's a set ofwaves you can see those lines and twoRiders up Healy andblue and that's Aaron Gold Healy deep onthis onesecondMark Healey is going to ride this onethroughandmaybe thinking that this may be the endof his heat and we'll see if he takes itto the shore break we saw that littleflashback of Bruce irons taking it tothe shore break Healy looking like hehas the same intent has to hop over acouple of these double ups and thatone's Just Gonna Rollto the shore we'll see if he decides topower back out or if he's going to takeit up on the beachthat was a massive set and a long ridethere for Mark Healy and you saw thatshore break in how it pounds[Music]in fact Eddie Aikau was known to save alot of people from this shore break thistreacherous shore break heresaid that one of his strategies was ifyou if you save them too soon they won'tlearn their lessonso we had a technique of allowing peopleto feel the Mana of this short break andas they were getting in uh close to theshore break and he had worn thembeforehand in fact the white malelifeguards will tell you today the bestway to keep people safe is to keep themaway from the water line as you see thatwater comes up like that if you're tooclose to the shore it'll sweep you offyour feet and drag you out into thatshore break and Eddie ikaw was known forsaving many people precisely who are inthat kind of a predicament now you cansee Mark Healey taking himself over intothe corner there where there's more of asurge and not as much of that crunchingshore break that you will find in themiddle of the beach or on the other sideof the beach so smart exit for MarkHealy and to your point even today atthe bay we have caution tape at the hightide line way far up on the beach andour city and county lifeguards aretelling people not to cross and ofcourse there's always going to be acouple of peoplewho just don't listen and that's whysometimes people have to learn the hardway like Eddie Aikau used to let peoplelearn the hard way but you know whatsave yourself the drama listen to ourcity and county lifeguards look at thisdrop oh my goodness and oh barelyhanging on before getting blasted offthat looked like it was Greg Longthat was an exciting wave incredibledrop we thought for a moment he wasn'tgoing to make it then he did make it andthen the wave exploded him in the end soa lot of drama here at Waimea Bay moresets out on the horizon couple look atthis incoming swell that have beenlighting up the buoys here on Oahu a lotof anticipation for a couple of days andnow it's

say abouthis participation in this event wellthat's very well said and it is uh spoton when we talk about what we'recelebrating what we're memorializing whowe are talking about and the way thatthat he was uh you know known to livehis life and of course being the firstlifeguard Here Eddie saving thousands oflives andum you know went out doing uh that verything for his good friends on board thatvoyageout there in the orange Jersey is makuaKai Rothman makua 38 years old he's aformer big wave World Champ 2014.makua's out there surfing through thepain didn't want to miss this one blewout his knee at the at the shootout hashis all braced up he knows he's going toneed some surgery and some work on thatbut he's not missing the day yeah youknow walking uh the shot of him walkingon the beach before his heat I noticedthat brace you know it'ssuper Hefty and for obvious reasons butyeah that heat at the shootout I mean itwas a a really treacherous day for foreven that particular heat where BillyKemper the day before makua Kai Rothmanand kala Grace all surfing for the sameteam and um you know just had a seemedlike a barrage of injuries at the timeand I saw makua on crutches and he wasgoing to get his MRI and um uh you knowall the tests done that evening that heinjured it and it didn't look good youknow as far as you know from my visualassessment when he showed me and waskind of moving it around or touching itand it's like oh man you know hoping thebest for you andsure enough it's going to need a lotmore medical attention but he ispowering through andnot going to miss this opportunity and Iwas kind of wondering you know after Isaw that injury like oh and if it doeshappen what you know he's gonna have adecision to make yeah I talked to makuraand he said you know I'm gonna go paddleout he may have a leash attached to ofhis uh vest his body rather than to hisleg correct so that it's not going topull on that bad knee I think that washis strategy his other strategy he toldme was hey I'm not going to wear a leashat all because if I fall I'm not goingto win but it looks like he's got aleash on it looks like he's got it allrigged up mccookai Rothman let's roundout this heat I thought he was going togo you know Tommy Chong Ming style uhyou could put him on the front foot youcould put it on your front foot as wellMatt keckley another guy who would dothat Buzzy curve box another front footleash guy a little bit on Orthodox butwe got a ton of Surfers in history whohave gone for that John Roseman anotherone each their own uh well rounding outthe lineup in the black Jersey we havethe eldest Surfer in this year'sEddie most experienced and the mostexperienced2001 champ Ross Clark Jones is out therein the black Jersey and as we look athistory Ross Clark Jones had uhRocky was the first Surfer not fromHawaii to win an Eddie that is a prettycool uh stat you pull up there and um Ihad the pleasure of watching thatVictory uh driving one of those jet skisfor our uh our main producer anddirector here Mike Prickett back inthose days of salt and air Studios anduh he's like oh this camera equipment'sonly worth about forty thousand dollarswe just can't get it wet like whatand he's like can you get close so wecan get a good shot with all the sprayscoming over he's like hugging the cameratrying to keep it dry I'm like wowthanks Mike there he is Ross Clark Jonesuh like I said the 2001 champ theum had you know and in that final or thefinal Shane Doran was the runner-up in2001 there they took out the win thirdplace in 2001 was a guy I got to knowand he put saved me a bunch of times uhAnt-Man Ant-Man Paul Patterson I was inthe back of the ski this year at uhMargaret River and holding on for dearlife but uh Ant-Man like yourself Rockya expert in uh in jet ski operation andin water safety yeah especially in thewaves you know there's there's such a acalculated technique and and knowingwhat the the machine canning can't doand where you can get uh for those epicshots and obviously for safety reasonswant to come in and uh mahalo Hawaiianwater Patrol and all of our brothers outthere looking after these competitorsand photographersbut yeah Paul Patterson that year oh mygosh you I thought he was going to winhe had some waves that I mean it wasmust have been so close between firstsecond and third because those guys wereall going off I'm gonna dig up some morestuff but I think Paul Patterson was inthe top six a couple of times during theEddie but just quite a quite a chargerhim and and his brother Jake out ofWestern Australia here we got a wave ohmananddestruction on the bottom so that lookedlike the blue board maybe a purplejersey could have been Ian Walsh bearwith us on the iding of the surfers wedon't have a spotter here in our studioso Rocky and I are just using prettymuch our innateknowledge of stances recognition of theStyles The Stance yeah you look regularversus Goofy and thenum the purple and the black white inthis morning light sometimes uh resembleeach other so that'll be a a little bitof a tricky ID right off the bat butwhoever that was was charging on thatdrop and that thing just exploded and hewas gone I'm gonna go with uh Ian Walshon that one just because I'm going todefault to the board color got it nowthe look at Ian yeah it'll be super lateyou see the board chattering almostlosing some traction on the drop andthen once he gets to the trough it isgame over that lip was just chasing himright down on his tail and uh you knownot even the great Ian Walsh could holdon to that so you know that wave hadsome explosion yeah Ian just such agreat spokesman for the big waveCommunity as we see walking down thebeach Francis Justine Dupont he's beenreading herself for the padlock andJustine has just been setting the bigwave world on fire with her performancesat places like Jaws Nazareth and mostrecently that mysterious Cortez Bank outin the Pacific yeah that crazy middle ofthe oceanwhatever it is man it's just a hugechunk of reef hey looks like uh we gotKelly Slater on his first wave Rockthat was blue and uh looked like you dida little uh fun heel side Dismount justto uh test the waters a little bityeah Kelly Slater uh 50 years old geez Icannot believe and it's just in anotherEddie and uh Kelly's actually come theend of the monthwell as we start the world surf LeagueChampionship tour over a pipeline that'sgoing to be the Billabong Pro pipelineKelly is our defending champ as we startoff the year there for w-cell yeah andhe's got a birthday coming up yeahso he's gonna be 51.during all of this excitement wow yeahwhat a story what a uh you know comingfrom Cocoa Beach Florida you know Idon't know if you guys have ever surfedover there I've been over there quite abit uh with some ties to that state andthere are hardly ever waves that areover maybe head high and you've got toget really lucky and a really goodstring of hurricane storms and whatnotto be able to have consistent surf buta guy from Cocoa Beachcoming out owning pipeline for as manyyears as he haswinning an Eddie ikauyou know 11 World titles is also veryimpressive for anybody from anywhere buthere we go check out the replay of Kellyas well oh excuse me wait a minute soagainblue though we have the surfer in bluewe're watching the surfer in blueand now we're looking at that Surfer inblue and thinking that is not KellySlater so I need some information fromthe beachum it looked a little different than thebelliesyou know style and whatnot and on afirst Quick Glance like we got weweren't quite sure of it on the replaywe got a chance to study it a little bitand umwe'll have to say that was uh that was amountain lion not a cheetah on secondlookforeignso each of these Heats are 45 minutes inthis first round and on the outsidecheck out red super late drop that wasMikey red in the red how appropriate andnow just a little uh lean back and rollup the window small kind but what a deeplate drop from Mikey red putting himselfin position for a good score that's whatthe judges want to see are those hugelate dropsthe deeper you are the better for thisWaimea big wave scoring system and Mikeywas fitting those two points of thecriteria very wellmade it to the bottom had a little bitof uh uh shakiness getting through thattrough but was able toride it out here we go look at that justhuge drop that was black in the frontthat was Ross Clark Joneson the shoulder just a little too kindof caught up in the lip but Mikey rednice big dropgood deep takeoff made it to the bottomyou know kind of stumbled at the endthere butmy opinion that was really well done andthe Mikey should get maybe possiblyum look like one of the steeper anddeeper drops on a bigger wave of themorning so Mikey red turning in a goodone andthere goes Mr Kai Lennyheading outfor Heat number three Thailand from Mauisee our Surfers kind ofgathered up closely right there in atight takeoff Zone and on a normal day anon-competition day a non-eddy day atWaimea right there your entire screenwould be filled with Surfers trying toattempttheir dream wave at Waimea Bayand there's all of our crowd trying tosit on every dry piece of Aina piece ofrock that they can find sometimesgetting a little too close looks likeeverybody's so far behaving themselvesbut that is the scene here on the NorthShore every time the Eddie Aikau isrunningthe Crowds Aresteaming with excitement andanticipation the energy you can feelfrom the crowd on the beach when thesehuge waves roll in and a surfer isriding it is quite infectious andthere's pretty much nothing like it Imeanthe waves are huge it's great you canyou know but the accessibility forpeople to come down here and watch inperson uh is just an amazing scene of acrowd down there yeah just stay behindthe yellow tape please that's fireseating coming out okay Rocky I had toget on the hotline and get anexplanation yeah I appreciate that sothat was not Kelly Slater out there inthe blue jerseythat is our alternate heart is up therecool so uh Beach Marshall and all youguys out there keep the informationrolling to us here on the set so we cankeep on bringing people accurateinformation

deep takeoff uh youknow right where you want to be forthose good scores Ross Clark Jones wasout ahead a little further down the lineactually got caught on the lip and hadto bail out Mikey made it all the wayand it was a pretty well written awayfrom like a big one and nice and steepas well let us say uh Mahalo to thebrothers uhhooking me up with some boards and somewaves uh I was cruising around our stateearlier this weekend so Mahalo got tocatch some waves about so good fun whileI was surfing and this looksfun to be on the beach watchingmaybe fun to be on a ski cruising on theside but on a

the dropat least get over to that that cornersection as uh we see Eli Olson gettingready oh he is frothing and he's beencoming on strong in the last uh severalyears really uh kind of finding hispath in pro surfing yeahuh so we're talking about the the waterangle and how it is our unsung heroeslet's hear from one of the best in thewater and his story from 2016 Zach Doylewas out there swimming all daythe plan was to be on a jet ski most ofthe day all the day we wanted to be outthere and not miss a single moment andwhen I got out in the water the waveswere so big when they would close outthe jet skis had to go to Shoreline sowhen I saw thisyou know what I'm gonna swim this and soI jumped off the jet ski and ended upswimming for the entire dayand I'd be left out there a few timeswhen the jet skis had to go and avoidingthe waves and I had to dive under thewaves and I've never felt power likethat before in any wave around the worldthere we go the story from Zack Noel andthe vision of Hawaiian water Patrol andhow they had to beach the skis whichthey had to do just again here soum hey the drill works the sacrifice isevident in uh what great storytellinglooking back to 2016 the last time thisevent ran yeah that was just uh such achilling image ofall those jet skis basically you knowand and guys upon them that are highlyexperienced watermen and the best in theworld and they are hightailing it out ofthere shows you who's boss yeah well whyman is always the boss and uh just allof these Warriors really you know agreat Gathering right of the best BigWave Riders in the world

eight surfers we have two ladiesout there two women competing in thisEddie so let's start off with JustineDupont and we'll see first who catcheshis first opening wave on the backhanddropping into this oneand let's get an ID on that one it lookslikered and that would be Portugal's Nickvon Ruppgone rub coming from Portugal and isknown for surfing massive waves overthere on the Atlantic coastlineand awesome to see him here in thePacific at Waimea Bay yeah also on thelineup in the pink jersey is JustineDupont Justine Dupont 31 years oldrepresenting France and one of ourfemale competitors out there she hasbeen an incredible Force within big wavesurfing as we see Nick on the paddleback out there in the red jerseydid you see that recent wave of her atCortez Bank yeah that was one of thebiggest waves ridden andum this winter and possibly even youknow I'm not sure how they're doing themeasurements of that but that wave wasmassive yeah Justine Dupont with arecent strike Mission with GarrettMcNamara and crew that hundred foot wavecrew out to the Cortez Bank a wave thatbreaks so far out at Sea that there's noevident in landmarks at all it's amiracle of the big wave world out therein the blue jersey another femalecompetitor in the way of Conley butwe'll get to it first tothis waveReplay for orange that's Landon McNamarahow amazing way for Landon that was abig one and there was a part of therodeo ride where it looked like it wasuncertain if he was gonna make it or notbut rides around that beautiful Drop youcan see how he's behind the section thewave is barreling behind him has towiden his stance to ensure that he canmake it through that heavy part and doesso successfullystiley there by Nick von Rupp on thereplayLandon McNamara 26 years old native ofthe North

of Maui andthis is going to beKai'sumdebut at the Eddie so he's a big Forcewithin the big wave Riding community butit's good to see Kai Lenny out hereright and that's probably just becausewe haven't ran the Eddie event in somany years because Kai has been aMainstay in the big wave surfingCommunity definitely has incredibleaccolades and has pushed big wavesurfing to a whole new level and so he'sone of the best out there todayand we're talking about Jake Maki Jakemockey went to Kahuku High Schoolum really made a name for himself as ayoungster while charging really bigwaves last season he was recognized forsending it over the ledge on some reallylate ones and here we have that replayof not another than kai Lennyhad to make it through that white watersection and a great ride for for Kaithe Akai Lenny a surfer that's beensuccessful in a number of differentcrafts he's won on the stand-up paddleWorld Tour he's won on the big wave tourhe's won in a big wave Towingcompetitions just recently taking a winat Nazareth last year along with his toepartner Lucas chianka who is going tosee in Heat number four uh shumbo shouldbe out there Heat number four who'skailani's tow partner at Nazareth whenthey took that big winso uhgreat performance by Kai he would be inmy book one of the favorites for thisyear's competition so we'll see how itends up at the end of the dayyeah and likeum we're talking about with with some ofthe youngsters that come out here earlyin in uh we're talking about Jake Makibut also with kailani made a mark forhimself when he was really young EddieAikau is similar in that way he startedsurfing the North Shore when he was only16 years of age was brought out herewith um particularly a guy named JohnKelly who was a old-timer he also servedwithum uh with the Cole family and with someof the the pioneers of Waimea Bayanother person he looked up to greatlywas a guy named kealoha uh North Shorenative from Laie who's surfing WaimeaBay back with the guys like Greg Knollin the late 50s and so Eddie Aikaureally made a Mark here on the NorthShore at a young age when he was only 16years oldwent on to become the North Shore'sfirst lifeguards and uh saved hundredsof lives rounding out our eight bandheat we have to mention out there inBlacktile Shipman is uh in his first Eddiefrom the East side from Kailua 46 yearsold got the invite which is a huge hugecompliment to a relatively undergroundsurfer in the way of Tayo so he's gothis opportunity here he's in the blackJerseyyeah so we're honoring at this eventEddie Aiko is actually born on Maui hisfamily he has there's six of them intotal of children uh Fred Gerald SaulEddie Myra and Clydeand so his family born in on Maui hisfather worked as a stevedore in KahuluiHarbor they decided to pack up and moveto Oahu and he was only 12 years old atthe time was already surfing a littlebit on Maui his father was you know anocean guy himself and when they came toOahuinterestingly they didn't have a placeto stay until they they found a dealwith a Chinese graveyard that if thefamily took care of the graveyard theycould live on the property rent freethat's why I was going to bring up withyou I believe that's in power on theSouth Shore where that graveyard yeahso Eddie and Clyde were known this andthe whole family in fact because they'reocean lovers uh his dad's name was Saullike cow and his mom Henrietta and theywould go to Waikiki Beach as a youngfamily and spend a lot of time there andright there at Waikiki walls was likethe epicenter of where the kids would goand play and Surf and ride on these wellwe call pipel boards which werebasically boogie boards made out ofplywood and so young Eddie and Clydespent a lot of time at that wall ridingthese waves on these plywood boards inthe surf in Waikikithen evolved as Surfers do discoveredthe North Shore correct right yeah so uhit it became apparentapparently there's a story where theirfamily was at uh I think it was aWaikiki show where they were watchingthis Surf video of of big wave surfingon the North Shore and Eddie wasmesmerized by I mentioned earlierriding these massive waves like we'rewatching here today he looked at his dadand he was only 14 years old at the timeand said I am going to ride the biggestwaves uh ever seen and I'm gonna makeour family proudand that was as a 14 year old and withinthe next couple years he ended up doingthat coming to the North Shore with as Imentioned earlierum the founder of the group called saveour surf John Kelly and surf the NorthShore when 16 years old get ready forMason oh he's coming down the beachright now Mason's going to be in Heatnumber four here and he prepares hispaddle out to the BayMason ho is uh got the distinct honor ofSurfing the Eddie this year alongsidehis father Michael ho which is just anincredible story and I do want tocorrect myself I called Ross Clark Jonesat 56 the oldest Surfer in this year'scompetition I was wrongUncle Mike65 years old is going to be out there inthe Eddy and Michael ho continues to wowthe surf world of beinggosh I'm going to say the best 65 yearold surfer in the world perhaps I agreewith that I just watched him at pipelinelast week charging second Reef pipegrabbing rail pulling in the barrels itwas a previous uh winner at pipelinePipeline Masters with the cast on hishand as he was grabbing rail pulling inthe back massive barrels then incredibleto have 65 year old Michael surfing withhis sonand the legacy of family we're reallycelebrating here todayum so awesome to have these familieslike the whole family the ikau familyand so many others that we're seeing uhwe talked also aboutum the Moniz family so really cool howhere at Waimea Bay we're celebratingthese families and uh particularly theseHawaiian families we're talking aboutnowokay we got a paddle This Could BeTayo shipment taking a look at that asweflip the camera thereand Tayo actually you know I mentionedfor two years from uh resigning Kailuabut he actually grew up uh across thestreet from Sunset Beach so it was wasraised in powerful surf here we go overthe fall oh my goodness before yellowthat was Jake Makiand we'll identify who's on the shoulderthere as we get to the replaysby just bombing sets us see set numbertwo Isaiah and what it holds in forstart if we have any takersyeah but it was so heavy Not only was ittall but it was wide and you know thosethick ones that Barrel like thatrequire a lot of courage to paddle intothose as the water as you're paddlingdown the face of these waves the wateris coming up at you so being able tomanage to go down while water is comingup takes a lot of skill and couragebecause that water is also going to endup on your head if you don't make itHoldings clear in the lineup all eightof our Surfers again to refresh you onthe format hereeight Surfer Heats and at the topthree waves from Two Rounds in theseeight Surfer Heats will go into yourscore here we go look like Eli Olson wason the edge there as we check out thereplay but Eli got eaten upso you can see Jake injecting Eli makingthe drop but then catching it on thebottomas I mentioned earlier that wave was sothick not only tall but wide in whichwhen that you saw both Jake was unableto um to make it into the wave becauseif wave was pitching him out over whatwe call over the fallsand Eli was able to make that drop butbecause that wave barreled so stronglybehind him was obliterated at the bottomas that wave detonated right behind himyeah Eli Olson 30 years old from theNorth Shore uh he was a double XL RedBull paddling champ in the past he'salso a jiu jitsu black belt Eli is andlately Eli's been doing someincredible work for Hollywood he's uhhe's been a stuntman on a number ofmovie projects as we have a vision hereof the ski ride out for Mason ho Masonwith his trusty Pat Rawson gun under hisarmyeah we saw Mason in 2016 catch one ofthe biggest waves of the entirecompetition and you can see the wave wasactually closing out but he was ridingit nonethelessI don't try to scratch into that oneunable to do that you can see theoffshore winds Isaiah holding theSurfers upin the lip so that it almost makes everydrop of airdroprighthere looks like we have a wave in theback got a rider standing up dropping iton this one backside looks like Nick vonRupp see if he can make it through thatexplosion behind him disappearsso great Style by Nick von rub Nick vonRupp hailing from Lisbon Portugal withthe Eddie coming on and off and big waveswells this is his thirdtriphalfway around the world just thiswinterNick von Rupp he's been you knowchalking up some airline miles everytime he hears about the swell every timehe hears about even a possibility he'shopping on that plane in Lisbon andthat's a long journey because usuallyit's Lisbon to Charles de Gaulle Charlesde Gault in New York New York toCalifornia California to Hawaii butright now he's sending it at Waimea abeautiful Drop The Wave was barrelingbehind him grabs his railtry to get through that section but itwas just too much water to handleyeah great great Style on that rail graba little bit of a tuck knee there andwe'll see how the numbers come in assoon as we get updated on theleaderboard we will share thatinformation with you here at the 10thrunning of the Eddie big waveInvitational all in memory of The Lifeand Legacy of Eddie Aikauyeah so as Eddie was a Youngster livedin town up there near Papa coleo hisfamily lived on a cemetery would takethe Trek out to the North Shore as a 16year old in fact he opted toexit high school at the age of 16 buthis dad was you know pretty strict onhim so he said well you got to dosomething so we got a job working at thepineapple Cannery down there in Honoluluand would work at nights and then whatthat did was it freed up his schedulefor the daytime so as he was savingmoney at night and uh was able to catchrides out here initially with John Kellyand others and and really fell in lovewith the North Shore and was able tokind of moonlight at work and then comeand surf all day longall right so look taking a look herewe got a wave coming through we have aninterested paddler and we'll see ifsomeone picks it up on the inside on thescratchclick title on the drop theresee if you can work this through ontothe insidecasual approach for the first time EddieSurfer and you know just getting invitedinto this event is an accomplishment onitself Isaiah right in fact that bringsus to a story of Duke hanamoku when hewas firstinvolved with surfing competition whenin 1965 he went and checked out theinaugural famous Duke Invitationalcompetition which was uh North Shore'sbig event back then in the 60sI was a it was a you know exclusive listthat he was still pretty young and notinvited in that year but the very nextyear both he and uh Ben IPA two localSurfers were invited to that eventokay we have a replay of Tayo nice dropa little bit of error under the board ashe dropped down on that wavemags backyeah so um speaking as we finish offthis replayspeaking of Duke kanamokuyeahwell with his tile right here we'regonna go two times on this replayspeaking of Dukan omokuumtoday is actually uh the day that Dukepassed away that that we lost DukeJanuary 22nd1968. soum gosh there's just been a lot of Manaa lot of energy insignificance on thisday and that is uhso you know so powerful and that's whythis that's why this Eddie Isaiah youcan talk about it more it's so much morethan just a surf competition exactlyand I mean it's interesting how allthese pieces of this puzzle this storyare coming together too I'm talkingabout um you know Duke's passing in 19681967 is when Eddie actually surfed inthe The Duke Invitational and they saythere's this really powerful moment whenuh when Eddie Aiko made it to the finalsand got a trophy you got sixth place inthat final but Eddie Aikau anddukahanamoku had this exchange at theceremony when they were recognizing uhthe the awards and there's this famousphoto of dukanamoku putting his armaround young Eddie and in some wayspassing the torch from one Hawaiiangeneration to the next and Eddiedefinitely hadum you know some shoes to fill as far aslike maintaining that Legacy and a hedefinitely did but particularly out hereat Waimea Baychecking out in yellowthat is uh the teenager Jake Makiand we saw Jake take a tripover the falls one that nobody wants totake but right now Jake getting asuccessful ridetrying to ride that through the insideand uh you know I gotta update right nowon the leaderboard and it looks likeand it's early days but uh with thesingle highest wave score right now RossClark Joneswith the single highest wave score wherewe as we look at live action hereand our Surfer in red kicking out Ior actually that could have been Orangeum Landon McNamarareally close betweenred Nick von Rupp and yeah both aregoofy foot and we don't have a spotterin here so uh bear with us as we ID theSurfersyou were talking about these kind ofconnections interesting that Mason hosein this next Heat I was telling a storyabout uh the Duke Invitational whereEddie Aikau was uh got the trophy fromduke hanumoku himself the year beforeDuke passes away this was at uh Duke'sum there was this nightclub that thatwas had there and Don Ho was theperformer and Don Ho uh the cousin ofMichael ho so this interestingconnection to the surf world and in thatentertainment community and Hawaii ofcourse is is a small island but lots ofcool connections with our stories yeahand and a lot of legacy to to beum to be celebrated Michael's dad Chicoho Waikiki Beach Boy as well made thatlifestylemuch like a guy's like Duke kanamokuEddie Aikau all part of the culture ofHawaiians sharing the experience tomalahini

consistent in themorning and we've got some big setswe've seen a lot of big sets in thecompetition even in these early roundsand you can look up to the Horizon seethose lines coming in so it's anexciting day to see the big waves almostheld the event last week but I think itwas the right call to wait for this daywhen the waves were much bigger and moreconsistent and a lot of action

jumpsoff other one's still going so it lookslike Jake Maki the youngster from theNorth Shore of Oahu surfing in his firstEddie is able to complete a ride therebut we get to the replays we'll see whois deeper on that unable to to growsuccessfully I like young Jake righthere I like his line he's taking thisone through kind of the flats in theinside let's see if he goes for theshore break and gets bucked off beforethe shore breakbut great effort by the young Jake Makiyeah these guys are riding big boardsanywhere between nine feet and 11 feethere we have a rider up oh as the waterbounces him off that uh wave Eli Olsenlet's see it is a little tricky on someof those with the water uh chopped tothe face and saw Elitrying to make his way through that waveas it chattered him up the faceoh emerge it from the White Water thereKai Lennyin his first Eddie and we were talkingabout Kai as one of the Premier Big WaveRiders in the entire world Kai Lennysurvives the storm and energeticallypaddling back outthe new father from Maui incredible BigWave Riders put on big wave performancesthroughout the entire Globe but thistime he's taken his game to the bay andhis first Eddie so great ride for KaiLennyyeah Kai has a way of making big waveslook enjoyableuh turns his board really well he'sworked really hard on equipment to wherehe rides boards they're a little shorterthan most and you can see that the waythat he's able to to turn andum that last wave looked really excitingfrom emerging from that explodingwhitewashLandon McNamarataking off on this one the surfermusician and second generation Waimeawriter here with Landon and LandonIsaiah looking like he wants to make theconnection yeah it looks like our Ridersare all going for the distance usuallyyou'd want to kick out but riding thisthrough this frothy foamy bumpy insidesectionand we're nearing the end of this heatso I have a feeling that Landon is justtakingthe best way to shore that's riding awave and he's going to complete all theway throughto the shore break land in McNamaraEddie Aikau was known a lot of ourSurfers have their signature surfboardlook and Edie Aikau is known for thisred board it was a Hobie surfboard thatwhen he was a teenager and just got thatjob working at the pineapple Cannerysaved up enough money to try and getthis board apparently it was in thewindow of this surf shop and it was adick Brewer board and eventually he wasable to save enough money to buy thisboard and and look at all the photos ofhim and of memories of him that redboard really stands out for for youngEddie especially was his youngstersurfing out here Waimea Bay also worethe signature white shorts with the redstripe across it so Eddie was very umhad his Look to Him yeah it looks likeLandon not taking that one all the wayin and decides to get back out there andHawaiian water Patrol giving Landona quick ride to the channel droppinginto this one big wave out in frontTau Shipmanso great execution before the first timeEddie invitee as a paddle here Kai Lennybig drop Lenny way deep Eli Olsenfurther on the shoulder but it's goingto be Kai Lenny who's going to hang inhere and Lenny just with that strongstance coming through riding with Elilooks looks like both Surfers areinterested to go through the showeverybody Kyle with the Bunny Hop Elidecides to stick with it and let's seewhat Eli has on the shore break hereIsaiah big section oh my goodness tripleup double up washing machinewhy may a shore break andEli Olson with a strong stance takes itall the way through a little claim toformer Eddie winner Bruce irons withthat Shore Break ride oh that was anamazing wave three guys on that wave butuh Kai Lenny was the deepest had thebest line I think behind everyone butman exciting to have this wave shared bytwo gentlemen and all the way throughthe short break we have Eli Olsonand you can see that's just the insidesoup right there that's just thebeginning of the story at Waimea there'sso much more to it but that in itself isa huge challengeyeah a lot of turbulence a lot of energythere's so much power in this oceanespecially here at Waimea Bay this deepbay where the swell is coming from thesestorms way out to sea and the way itgoes from deep water to the hit or orthis Bay in here just shows all thatwater and that energy just coming to thebeachflying through here you can seethe acreage of white water that it takesafter a set in the jumbled up Bay hereat Waimea beautiful conditions offshoreconditionsincoming swell that's still on the risethroughout the day making for an epicday you can see the seam right there thegiant boil out at Waimea that's a partof the whole lineup here and Jake Makitaking a look at that one and decidesnot to ride that bucking wave as itrolls through here at Waimeayeah the Surfers have to be selectivebecause some of these waves areunmakeable and they want to make surethat they're pulling the trigger on theright ones especially since they onlyhave four waves that they're allowed ineach of their Heatsit's a clear view down the North Shorecoast and our drone flying by the lineupas we see a scratch by Jake Maki hewants in on this oneJake's upand a bumpy ride down the face but theteenager from the North Shore hangs onto that one cutting to this angle hereof Landon Landon marriedoh my goodness that looked like acloseout set behind themmy goodness this is reminiscent of 2016when we had those sets that would comethrough and close out the entire Baycatching up with Jake Maki here and looklike uh tile Shipman as well may uhwe'll see if he's still attached to hisboard may have lost his board this thisset Isaiah as we take a look hereappears to close out the entire Baywe'll get a visual of thatum and maybe the angle so that it reallygives us you know theohmagnets the consequence yeah and themagnitude of this the front on angleof that closeoutif you're wondering what Jake Maki justdid he's trying to get under the wave sohe stood up on his board to get an extrabit of uh momentum to dive underneath itbecause all this white water is comingover you you want to try and getunderneath it touh avoid its its turbulence as much aspossible our Hawaiian water Patrolstaying busy here that was a big wavethat probably washed most of ourcompetitors out so they're checking thelineup to make sure everyone's safelet's check

these these days at the bay when thewaves are this big and treacherous andand clean at the same time are prettyrare and that's why this event onlyhappens once a while we're seeing thegoat Kelly Slater thereJohn John Kelly and Nathan Florence allhaving a conversation hereKelly giving John John some coachingsaying John look it here's how you do itnot sure why uh Kelly opted out thisyear but I'm sure he has his reasonswell Kelly Slater is a is a Levitt timeWorld Champ a smart Surfer and maybe Ithink he's saving himself becausestarting January 29th the championshiptour kicks off at the Billabong Propipeline where Kelly Slater is thedefending champ there so Kelly's Focuswould obviously be on Pipeline what aincredible feat it would be for KellySlater to go back to back and take hisninthtitle ninth championship at the pipelinehere we go on the paddle outfor the next Heat that looks like uhpurpleoh we'll catch up to that whenwe get that Vision againso one of the years that the bay wasnoted for one of its biggest days was uh1967 on November 19th it was on a Sundayand on that November 19th the waves wereso big that it was closing out and youcouldn't ride it there were two peoplewho were swept off the beach and drownedthat day but check this out live actionkailani again bunny hopping on thebottom a big mountain of white waterLenny survives that Kai Lenny putting onan impressive performance again I toldyou about at the beginning of the heat Iwas thinking that Kai is going to be oneof their top performers this year at theEddie and he's living up to thatexpectation switching stance onto theinside a little Showmanship from KaiLennyit's to our viewers it's not mostSurfers these days you pick one way youeither start with your left foot forwardor your right not both but Kai here ishaving fun with this riding what we callgoofy foot going through this shorebreakoh score that for Kai Lenny that was abrilliant ride some Showmanship Survivalon the outside Kai Lenny when the numbercomes in ice would suspect Kai is goingto go to the top of the leaderboardwe'll make that more official as soon aswe get all the the numbers from ourjudges but Kai Lennyimpressive yeah incredible first roundheat for Kai he had three waves that arereally good in that heat and so I thinkyou're right kite will be probably goingto see him jump up to the top of thatleaderboardKai paling back inand is gonna makethe interesting exit but uh he can holdhis hot head up high because he put onquite a performance as we're catching upthere to Nick von Rupp coming in fromheat three in this

Hollow wave oh broit's like his skateboard when hit therock and then he just went on theasphalt but more worse when you stayaway me a beer browell thankfully Hawaiian water Patrol isdoing amazing stuff so Zeke is there uhchecking on something deflating his hisvest most likelyyeah so we've been uh fortunate with thedevelopment of Technology we're nowwe're have these CO2 cartridges insertedinto these vests they're able to pull acord and inflate themselves in order toget up from uh you know being held downtoo long underwater and you know thattechnology has been around a while ithas on the airplaneyou know how they get that thinginvested I've played it so fast the bestoh man yeah but I'm glad to see itapplied in a practical sense for ourSurfers and along Kamehameha highwayright there there those folks are on thelike the the median of the margin of thewhite line those folks walking were onthe road it is parking lot status paradekind the road shut down on that's why ifit was a school day you couldn't go toschool because yeahparking on the road you know in themainland they got snow days on the Northshow we got Eddie daysand um rounding out some of the Surfersin this heat we've got a anothernon-hawaii competitor but big waveveteran Pioneer Peter Mel fromCalifornia in this he in the red jerseyhe's been competing here before and uhhas beenone of the the Pioneers in this big wavesurfing sport for a long time and kindofextending out to New Frontiersdiscovering these big wave spots thatwe've seen pop up over the years sogreat lots of credit to Peter Mel forbeing on the Forefront of that andour Hawaiian Surfer in yellow from thebig island and absolute chargermulti-talented when it comes to wavewriting disciplines andso great to see him out here in theyellow along with the North Shore Zonein the purple jersey see him laying onhis board right there to the right ofyour screen Jamie O'Brien j-o-bthat's out here in the Eddy and thenlast but surely not least you cannot uhhave a fun great surf event withoutinvolving Mason ho our Surfer out therein Orange so Mason is gonna take a crackthere's his dad some Eddie action andPops yepamazing to have two generations ofSurfers in this event lots of love andAloha being shared there on the beachit's another Beauty about this event youknow a lot of camaraderie people realizethat I mean this is big and dangeroussurf they want everybody to be safe soeven though it is a competition it'salso uh you know lots of Aloha and lotsof help that they're you knowcamaraderie sharing here in the lineupyeah the vibe is that exactly as Michaelho will head down the beach and getready to be in that position you see theSurfers in Michael for the next Heatthese Surfers trying to get themselvesin the right spot for this heatedwe'll see some sharing of waves we'llsee multiple Riders on a wave which isallowed here at uhthe Eddie I cow the big waveInvitationalyep and you can see how our our Surfersthey pick their their lineups right likewhere do I sit do I situm you know further deep or do I sit uhfurther out and we're seeing a paddleherewe go red is our deepest there for airdropping into it that is Peter Mel doingit like a veteranyes sir still going strong but getseaten up at the bottom of that wave butwhat a drop amazing ride from Peter Millflew all the way over here fromCalifornia twice he was on the airplanelast week and he found out in the airthat we weren't going to run the eventbut opted to of course you know come andand for both of these uh you know daysat the base call in the day today and soPetedefinitely worth it on that last rideI think it's really cool rock this yearand every heat of these rounds here wego oh there's a replay of him yeah thatwas just a heavy drop and then rightthere just gets engulfedin White Water look at the water anglelooking into the wavejust a beasthow that water angle really shows youhow how steep and Hollow those waves area lot of power a lot of energyum here today at the bayso saying it's exciting that every oneof these Heats we have a wahine surferwhich is new to this event right we'veuh the first time we've actually hadfemale Surfers in the event and to havesix female Surfersreally amazing makani is our our femaleuh Surfer for for this heat and reallycool there we go a shot ofof Pete Mill paddling back out you cansee his vest uh inflated I was talkingabout that earlier where the CO2cartridge were inflated the paddle backout and you can deflate it to bring itback down I was going to say that thatthat's kind of a mustkind of must-have uh technology be ableto you know deflate it back to uh whereyou can paddle and move around but mantalk about having uh emergency rip cordplan to be able toreach down and pull it out look likePeter once again in the red jersey justswinging around on one that was a littlefurther inside just to get another waveunder his belt yeahbecause in ancient Hawaiian Societysurfing uh was something that everyonedid whether you're a male female youngor old okay that's really cool at theEddie event here today we're celebratingthat tradition of just being somethingthat people enjoy at all walks of lifeand all levels and all genders I wasgoing to touch on that a little bit asyou seeKellychecking out the conditions high and dryfor the moment he was replaced earlierwith an alternate so not sure uh if he'sgoing to be re-entering the event ormaybe he is uh taken this year to justCruise them and watch him but there'ssomewhat of a a myth or maybe amisunderstanding about surfing inHawaiian culture that it was onlyreserved for Ali or something like thatright um you know there was a bookwritten uh by Ben Finance is surfing thesport of Kings and the title had areally cool kind of ring to it I thinkunfortunately people made that uhassumption that that meant it was onlyfour Kings which is not trueum the Hawaiian historian David molowrites that surfing was a nationalPastime practice by all people nowchiefs were were often would havepriority in certain breaks in certainlineups as in all walks of life orHawaiian culture correct it was not uhseparated from the ocean right and andmost of the Chiefs too in ancient timesit was a way of of is displaying theirmana and their strength and their beautyand so so yeah we'd have a lot ofstories of guys like for example KingKamehameha was probably one of Hawaii'smost famous Chiefs was also an Avidsurferum but so is his wifeand so men and women enjoyed uh surfingor what we callin Hawaiian and so really cool to seeour our female Surfers out here in thelineup in at Waimea Bay which is ofcourse as we know some of the mosttreacherous and and um dangerous wavesyeah and you know wahine has beensurfing with us and Among Us for likeyou said Generationsand I was telling kaipo earlier you knowI from a a young kid growing up here onthe North Shore we all knew who Eddiewas what it meant and then we all hadthe posters on our wall with all thenames andum it was for a time you know the 80s90s and up until just very recently allmale contestants and competitors and Igot to give a lot of credit to thesewahine that have been out there andsurfing at Waimea as you see our nextteethdoing the heroes walk in front of thecrowd uh it is so cool to be down thereBeach level and get a good look at thesecompetitors where you you some part ofyou think that there's part of themthat's like Immortal not human and andnot you know just different from me as ahuman here as we watch blue on theoutside Ezekiel Lao he is puttinghimself in good positions out here yeahziklaouh Honolulu nativeand uh amazing server he's on thechampionship tour meaning uh the elitegroup of competitive Surfers and thatwill start up soon as kipe wasmentioning earlier but ziklao definitelya good ride and although he grew up inin Honolulu surfing the waves in townit's made a name for himself on theNorth Shore which is very similar toEddie aikau's story actually grew upthere in Honolulu near papakolea at thecemetery that the family lived out ofthere and made his way out here as ayoung 16 year old surfing the NorthShore in fact he became most famous bythis one swell in 1967 where the waveswere massive he was out here with hisred board made a huge name for himselfat that day at the bay and we see apaddler here in yellow making this dropwhoa that was like Beyond vertical thatwasjust putting himself over the ledgewhen we get the replay of that you'regoing to see just how steep that wavewas he was looking like he was holdingon about three quarters down he had itand then there's a point sometimes inthe wave where it's so steep or just soinverted these nine six plus ten footboards have a hard time fitting in thatcurve and I think that's what some ofthe uh trouble might have been for Kellybut absolutely charging on that waveyeah amazing from my hometown and Hiloon a big island in fact all my mybrothers uh cheering him onhere we go oh this was bluethat was Ezekiel Lao on the last one uhReplay that was really that was prettysteep you know in in regular motion itdidn't look like it was uh all that bigbut when it when he got to the bottomand you saw the wave really stand up andthen you see that beautiful drone shotcoming fromthe back and looking into it as we seeKelly is board just at the last momentpenetrate the nose and not able to makeit I was justto for him to make it that far down thewave on that steep of a wave was alreadyhuge accomplishment amazinghe also lots of waves here at Waimea Baytodayglad they made the right call rightbecause last week it was almost Eddieand then uh they decided to hold off andboy the ocean definitely delivered forus todayand it's on the rise still yeah thatthat's a fun part of what you thinkabout these guys describing the droppretty good you see them with his handangled real his elbow was real highthat's when you know that's a steep dropand just one more uh bit of credit tothe wahine that are out here and andbeen because to get invited to get yourname out you got to put in so much hoursofof uh you know being out here at the bayall sizes all conditions having you knowpeer recognition is a lot of itobviously media helps with that toogetting videos and photosso these girls uh these wahine in thisevent have put in so much time andthey're getting uh the payoff beinginvited to this Eddie and truly uh welldeserved and well earnedlooks like we got a paddle hereoh the wind blowing up the face whichalso adds to the difficulty of catchingwaves here at Waimea Bayyou have a lot of you it's not as easyas just paddling into a wave there'swind coming up the face there's watercoming up at you you've got the bigboard and that wind oftentimes blowingunderneath that board looks like TwiggyBaker Grant Twiggy Baker getting readyfor Heat number five we'll have tworounds of five Heats eight Surfers ineach heat so we've got40 competitors that'll be having twocracks at the bay today and I wastalking about earlier looking at thecrowd on the beach and the Surferswalking by so two things you really getto admire when you're down there on thebeach if you can Brave the crowds and Isaw the the cars and crowds lining upfrom last night along the highway overthere but if you can get down there itis a once in a lifetime experience youget to feel the Thunder of the Waves seethe actual height from Beach level thewaves I call them Horizon ticklers whenthey're just like almost coveringFeathering the covering the Horizon andthen you see these athletes walk bythese Surfers and you think of them asbeing like these huge Larger than Lifecharacters they're just mere mortalslike me and you but there's just socommitted and well trained and put in somuch time preparing their bodies andtheir minds it's a huge mind thing to beable to shove yourself over one of theseledges that are 40 50 feet tall atWaimea Bay seeing the Rocks right therethe whole the crowd the whole vibe it isjust a lot of adrenaline and butterfliestoo sometimes yeah we're talking aboutmana and that kind of energy that youfeel and Waimea Bay is got a longhistory of that mono whether it's backin the valley where they have thosethree hails here or just the energy fromthe oceanyou can see our water Patrol safetykeeping everybody safe out there yeahthey're pretty much operating uh on amoving River there's so much watermoving you're either going quickly withit or directly against it and needing tohave that incredible throttle control tomaneuver yourself in these waves safelywith Surfers and photographers allaround youand we're going to check out our goodfriend Kevin Wallace who's got theSurfline forecast for this Eddie swellthis powerful swell came from ahurricane four storm that was centered athousand to 1500 miles from Hawaii lateThursday through Saturday winds up to 40knots extended to an area 900 milesNorthwest of the islands as well thesestrong winds drove Peak Seas to nearly50 feet on Friday morning Hawaii timewith satellites verifying that a hugeswell is on the way we're going to seepumping surf all day today although it'sgoing to Peak from around late thismorning through the afternoon and windyconditions going to be epic throughoutthe day as well with offshore easterlytrade windsforeignthank you Kevin and you saw somesatellite footage of the clouds and andhow the storms form and they basicallylook like giant hurricanes and these arethese low pressure storms that start offof a uh Eastern Russia as we watch alive takeoff there on the outsidemight be Jamie O'Brien in purple maybe adarker Jersey or could have been tikanuiSmith In Blacknow those purple and black jerseys aregonna sometimes in the shadows and inthe uh unbalanced light might look alittle bit similarbut you saw that forecast and the arrowthat was pointing at that fetch on thatsatellite image and then we saw the umthat colored uh color-coded forecastsystem that showed a lot of energypointing right at the Majestic and verydivinely situated North Shore I like howyou tell the divinely situated becauseactually the bay wasa a place of Divination in fact the hailup on the North side of the bay and onthe cliffs there above of uh pupukea wasactually one of its purpose was fordivination they would align into theactually the largest hail on Oahu uhheyo is like a structure like a templelike it is large it's it's Acres yeahacres and it says it goes back uh AThousand Years wow and used for variouspurposes but umis uh that you know could be repurposeddepending on the situation and time okaybut it brings that kind of Mana that theBay has uh on Shore and in the ocean andit definitely contributes to that kindof Mystiqueof this place and look at this wave herein yellowwell that's Kelly your mamaso from that straight on angle sometimesit's so hard to find the surfer as theyhit the bottom of the wave or the troughof the wave from the wave before kind ofblocking view out the back that is redlooks like Peter Mel he's having himselfquite the day here Pete is catches hissecond wave and he's successful atriding these amazing job for the Condoryeah he is up there in the experiencelevel with the a guy we saw earlier RossClark Jones a couple of the ogs gettinga chance uh here at Waimea Bay and youknow they've been frothing the lastseven years wondering when the next timethey're gonna get this chance and ithappened here on January 22nd 2023I mean even though these are you knowmore seasons gentlemen they've had someof the best waves of the day so farright yeah uh Ross Clark Jones had thatbig closeout that was one of the thebest scores of the day andPeter Mel staying busy he had one rightat the beginning and cut a small littlebackup uh inside wave as we watchedKellytry to hold on through that airdrop thewind getting under the board and PeterMill yeah Pete takes a a straight linehere gets through that white washsection it's able to hold onright through nicelyoh you know what that wasn't Pete no ohthat was orange that was orange that wasnone other than Mason hope and the pinkand orange I mean excuse me the uh thered and orange looking a little similarthere so Mason good call Isaiah thankyou very muchand all forms of enforcement down on thebeach we saw city and county lifeguardswe're seeing ourPartners at HPD city and countyHonolulu Police Department getting readyor just being on standby in case any uhwild and crazy beach goers make abeeline for the ocean try to get oncamera nah just kidding that won'thappen but out the back in the whitejersey that is Lucas chiankaand Lucasbeen a staple for the Brazilian big wavesurf community and as you said beforepartnering up with uh local Maui boykailani for some toe-in partnershipyeah uh exciting to watch himespecially they do those towing surfingand recently he was on that strikemission for the hundred foot wave Chaseout at Cortez Bank yeah that is such ajust a crazy crazy place to surf andsomething notable about both Lucaschianka and Kai Lenny their boards areare shorter than most of the othercompetitors it does look that way Iwould I would uh agree with thatright now his board looks like he'sserving sunsetbut he's at the bay a lot of our Riderswill choose between like a nine foot and11 foot board usually about 10 foot iskind of common but that board lookedlike it could be even under nine feetpossibly Oh Billy Kemper so glad to seehim at least being able to make it downhere he had a pretty bad Wipeout gottaken away via ambulance during the backdoor shootout of our second of our threedays of competition that was lastSaturdayso we were I mean the warriors uh thewarrior Spirit here is alive and wellbecause these gentlemen did take abeating I mean not onlyum with uh with with our writer here butalso with uh mccookai Rothman and eventhough they're injured they're rightback out into this big surf so I'm tipmy hat to them yeah I mean it's not likethey're suiting up and paddling out thefour foot Rocky Pointdude they're suiting up and putting onArmor basically to get out and uhmaybe not necessarily do battle becausewe always talk about the flow and thesink that you want to have with theocean to perform well while you'resurfing even but we do a lot of timesuse the analogy of of suiting up forbattle when you're going out herebecause it is your body is just allsystems go you got to be firing on allcylinders as much as possible if we goout the back in the blue that is ZekeLau making it to the bottom emerges fromthathuge wall of white water andI mean it's basically like a snowboarderduring an active Avalanche I love thatcomparison because it's definitelychasing you downandtrying to get in on thatshoulder right there was I believe ourSurfer in Black tikanui Smith having alook at it but was not able to strokeinto itand justbeautiful Drone footage looks likesomething might be out the back herepossiblywe're in Heat number four we've got fiveHeats total with eight Surfers in eachheat and we have at least oneor two one represented in each heatmakuni adrik the wahine surfer from theNorth Shore in pink in this seat hereand we look at the replay of white yeahhe grabs Israel Lucas from Brazilgets around that wave looking whether ornot he wants to stay with it and thisone water angle has to grab his railgives that excitement shows us how steepit really isI will sayas a fellow goofy footer it would beawesome as we watch a replay of bluethat's Zeke just toying with it steppingon the tail air dropping ithe looks pretty confident out thereright now and I like it amazing thewater angle you see where he skips hehas a little bunny hop and air drop downthat massive waveand rides out successfully so Zeke's hada couple of good rides too but we haveyet to see a goofy foot Champion here atthe Eddieif I'm if I'm recalling correctly all ofour winnershave been regular foot and I liked thewave earlier from Landon McNamaracharging on that big set Lucas chiankagetting a couple rides here that uhcould you know put some scores on theboard for him or that will put somescores on the board Jake Maki had acouple of bombs so we'll see if this isthe year the goofy footer breaks throughI remember one year Navarro was reallyclosewe have some paddles herered and orange so we're not going to mixthem up this time this is both MasonHill and the Condor Mason and orangePeter Mel and then tikonui or Tahitiantikonui Smith outon the uh the end there Mason doing theswitch stance two times but goes down onthe second re-switchtrying to go back to regular so we sawPeter Mel the deepest in the red jerseyfollowed by Mason Hallflows to him in the orange and then outup out in front with tikanui Smith ourTahitian competitor in Blackthat was an amazing wave it could have aroom for all three of them here we havetwo Riders up on the same time that'sKelly mamala in front in the yellowandI believe uh either Jamie I think that'sJamie O'Brien in the purple that is uhbehind keali and we'll see if they'retrying to weave their way to the shortbreak oh almost there's so much waterthat is uh in the form of cross chopsand backwash and sidewash and any kindof washalthough anybody has the skill to ridethrough that rough section it'd be JamieO'Brien have you seen that video of himthis year riding the river yeah yeah noyou're right though I mean and just atestament of how rough it is right therea guy like Jamie cannot you know evengets bucked off his board therebut the shore break finale has beensomewhat of a a latter phenomenon of theEddie you didn't see too much of that inthe early days of this eventas we watch the replays Isaiah yeahthat's the shared wave between Mason andPete Milland uh tikanui on the shoulder therebeautiful ride great angle from theDronePete eventually gets bucked off by thewhitewash Mason doing his switch dancebut Pete ended up so close to Mason whenthey resurfaced I think Pete got draggedfor a little while there because he wasin the the meaty part of that waveas tikanui flies by and uh here's a nicereplay of j-o-b and Kelly malmalasharing a waveunique right Rocky most surfcompetitions you're not allowed to sharewaves that get an interference on butwhy may I be as long as you pick a cleanline where you're not interfering withyour right competitor then there's roomfor more than one yeah and then youspoke about the camaraderie and thebig Mutual understanding among thecompetitors that yes we're here to winbut we're also here to share thisamazing day of waves

four local girl bornand raised right here on the North Shoregot the hugegot support from a huge water ActiveFamilyuh I grew up surfing at Haleiwa from ayoung age with Uncle Reggie adricklifeguarding there Hanalei adrik doingsome backhand carves that were just uhidyllic for me growing up as a younggoofy foot andthe whole adrik family very well Adeptin these North Shore Waters in makhaniright now is the one representing thatOhana and Waimea Bay yeah I mean to yourpoint earlier Rocky it's not like uhwomen haven't been surfing Waimea bigit's just that they um this is the firstyear that we have uh competitors in theevent and to have six of them is reallyamazingand as mentioning earlier it is atradition of course in Old Hawaii thateveryone surf no matter your gender oryour age and so at the Eddie this yearwe're seeing that representedso really cool to have uh in this heatmakani and that was a great ride thatshe had what are some of the stories ormaybe some of um maybe some olelo aboutHawaiians of course we all know theysurfed places like Waikiki and and youknow more manageable waves of course theboards and Equipment they're using isabout as primitive as it gets but whatare some of the stories if there are ofHawaiians surfing bigger waves yeah sothe North Shore I mean this communityhere right here in Waimea was a verypopulated as a village and there are alot of people that lived here back inOld Hawaiian people surfed the NorthShore right and so we have stories of ofmany different Surfers in our levels ourour oral traditions and umso so yeah it's not something that onlytook place in Waikiki but something thatSurfers did around the islands andincluding on the North Shore in old daysand even though he sent me the equipmentuh you use the word primitive but theriver pretty sophisticated differenttypes of shapes and different boardsjust like we have today in Old Hawaiiyou've had boards for riding big wavesfor riding small waves you had boardsthat you would lay on boards that you'dstand on boards you'd use just as ahandgun or some for paddling so therereally was it was really an elaborateand well-developed art and Sport here inHawaii calledparking lot not so much a highway rightnow but folks are stoked to be here Iknow that uheverybody has been abuzz about thisevent for the last couple of days andpaddling looking over the ledge that onejust was not going

seewhere he is that's still just a thicklayer of foam and sometimes it's hard toget out of that so you can take a breatheven though the whitewash isn't near youstill the foam from the residual fromthe previous wave still hard make itchallenging to get through right you'reabove the water the surface of the wateryou're above the surface of the waterbut you still have another foot of foamto get your

shore breakaction here always a showman and Billyjust ejects there as he sees the wavesengulfs upon itself I'm so impressedthat he is here competing after uh whathappened at pipeline during the the Huibackdoor shootout and that wave that hegot injured on waslike a 10 foot first Reef Beast that hetook pretty much all on the shoulder Iwasn't sure exactly what part of him gotinjured I knew that he got brought backto the beach by Hawaiian water Patrolbut it was one of those waves whereyou just cringe when you watch it liveand then you watch the replay and thenyou see what happened and it's trulyamazing that he's being able to be outhere competing typoand he thought about the short break andI'm glad that he didn't uh for themoment just to maybe save it for thelast hurray but getting uh

these Surfers and to all ofthese Surfers but especially those thatare paddling out here hindered andinjured and still making a go at it aswe watched Jamie Mitchellfree fall from the top of this waveabout four or five stories high andsurviving the white water and if there'sanybody that's going to be able topaddle into these waves at Waimea Bay itis your 10-time Molokai to Oahu pronepaddling Champion Jamie Mitchell justseems fitto be a great paddler and transitioninto a big wave surfer[Applause]live action here and let's get an ideaon that Surferand on the paddle and uhbig wave Invitational that is just thebiggest of the biggesthere's the lineup folksdown on the beach level in the sandwatching out for that really uh Highwash through the water goes over theberm into the river we've seen folks gettumbled and rolled into the riverand uhlook for yourself on the various socialmedia platforms if you get rolled intothe riverso still trying maybe we can get areplay from that last ride still tryingto ID that last Surfer we have red outthere with Ramon Navarro Ramon being agoofy foot so that would have been himorange is Michael ho yep we saw him on awave so uhwe'll see if that last wave was Michaelpink is Paige almsthere is a little similarity with thepink and orange uh in the certainlighting at timesso here's our replaytell me who that is rock well that isredGrant Twiggy Baker excuse me that's redsorry it can't be remoteyou gave me three three tries Iappreciate it he tries bro oh swing ohit's so good so hey Jones I mean when welook at Paige alms a three-time winnerover at jaws so Paige really beingum when we look at the women in thiscompetition she wouldn't be the favoriteto finish uh the highest just be givenher history here 34 years oldoriginally fromVictoria British Columbia but moved toMaui years ago and took up the passionof Surfing and then led into a big waveriding page alms her partner Sean ordnisis also her shaper okay so closeconnection there with the the boardmaking that's always great to have uhfirst-hand input of what kind of boardsyou'll be riding and what you prefer andPaige like you said she has been doingthis for a long time only 34 but shestarted so young that we've seen hername among the top ranks of big waveSurfers for the last decade or Plusexplore.org Charlie Annenberg againstanding room only at wide mayor forthis Eddie and I got breaking news anduh with thisswell that we have coming right nowsometimes the heavens works with us andI do want to uh pay my respect andcondolences to the current familyearlier today we lost a y Maya and bigwave Pioneer Pat Curran father of TomI'm sure Pat's smiling down on us andgiving us his Mana right now this couldbe you know in 2016 we had lost our goodfriend Brock little who was anincredible wine male Surfernow with the passing of Pat and 2016we're calling that the Brock swell rightthis could very well be the pat Curranswell that we're seeing here today atWaimea and uh thank you so much for Patand for all the currents but especiallyPat Curran with as being one of a truePioneer no leashwith all of the big heavyweights of thetime as we watch another heavyweight bigheavyweight drop right there it lookedlike it was Billy Kemper again there'snothing holding Billy back he is on firecommitted and as we said earlier justhow special this event is to all of ourcompetitorsbut the ones that are paddling out therewith uh with injuries and with you knownot a hundred percent still giving it ahundred and ten percent as we see blueand red carrying away yeah Grant swiggyBaker and Ramon Navarro Twiggy righthere continuing on Twiggy deeper on thatoneGrant Twiggy Baker a veteran of of thecrewum he's out there riding his own modelhis Twiggy surfboards shaped by JeffBushman all right one of the North ShorePine uh Staples Staples yeah as far aswe look at big wave equipment JeffBushman has been doing it for decadesyeah and for non-hawaii Surferstraveling to Hawaii getting their winterQuivers he's one of the first guys theycallyeah how important is it Rocky to haveyou knowa reliable big wave gunreliable is uh is the key word becauseyou know you can see these waves are notall about like high performance as wewatch Billy Kemper drop in on a bombdisappears in the uh the fork thebackground of that wave before as wewatch Grant Twiggy Baker in the blue andRamon Navarro are two uh non-hawaiiSurfers in this heatGrant out of South Africa and Ramon iskaipo mentioned earlier out of Chile socool to see them sharing a wave andbeing able to participate in thisEddie Invitational butreliability on a big wave gun isprobably at this size is more importantthan like performance or you know whatyou're going to try to do on the wavebutas Isaiah said earlier these waves theseboards range from like 9 to 11 feet sothere's quite a a space there to gosmaller and try to carve and maybe getyourself into a barrel like Brock didmany years ago right off the drop youknow that same year he had that stoneskipping Wipeout he also had a sickBarrel speaking of Brock and we have alull right here we do have a piece withBrock little talking about hisexperienceat Waimea and that exact wave you weretalking about we see the crowd righthere just waiting for the next set butwe did get a a great speaking piece tobroccoli let's let's listen to it rightnowas well as West and it was just standingup like straight up and then you knowthe winds were straight offshore andhard so you couldn't really see whenyou're taking offjust had to go and they're perfect theywere they were from a perfect Directionyou could see it coming from a long wayout and everyone in my heat was justlike they they were Palling out and Iwas like I'm just gonna sit here and soI just sat there and waited and so Iturned around and I knew I was in a goodspot I knew everything was cool I got itand uh Bradshaw was like on the shoulderand I was like well I'm deeper so I'llgo and I think Bradshaw said I calledhim off but I I don't remember calling Idon't remember making any noise becauseif he I remember thinking actually nowthat I think about it that if Bradshawwants to go he can go in front of mebecause it's such a big wave it's such acool opportunity like to catch acloseout of my man and so then uhyou know I took off knowing you knowstood up and I was like I got thisit felt like there was so much watermoving that my board almost startedgoing backwards because it was such abig wave and I was sucking up so hardthat this my board didn't want to and Ilove that board it rolled some greatwaves but it just didn't like you knowkeep going it just wanted to go back andwanted to go up the face and all of asudden I was skipping and you couldn'tyou can't penetrate like when giantwaves you just kind of skip and so I wasjust skipping and I remember looking atthe lip coming over I'm likeoh boy and then actually I remember likeI had like a little thing of you knowbeing being in my mom's arms like youhave that kind of flash I was like ohI'm gonna die here but I got a breath sothen I you know gotta wrestle theirFalls blah blah blah blah ate itI think my leash came off but my boardpopped up right next to me and I didn'thave a leash on it was really weird andI don't think there was jet skis then Igot to my board and put on my leash wentback out and like even the some of thecompetitors were looking at me likeyou knowyou gotta screw loose who knowshappywe love you Brock and Brock little uhtalking about his experience at Waimea agood friend of ours and uh we love themwe miss them and that was one of thosewaves that's what makes the Eddie such amystical event in that things like thathappen and barriers are broken Brocklittle one of those Surfers breakingthose barriers riding his Gabe Gardensurfboard back then2016. Rocky was a rock swell and now wepay tribute to Pat Curran as well aWaimeaPioneer and I think Pat up in heaven ishelping us with these this wave energyhappening right now and the overallenergy in the Pacific and on Shore wellearlier you you spoke about you know thethe Heavenly alignment and what it takesto have an Eddy and the way this swellhas to line up and the timing the windseverything has to work almost to to aperfect tee to where today we startedwith very large waves huge wavesand Surfline is forecasting that we'regonna get this swell still coming in andpossibly increasing through theafternoon which I remember Eddie swellsthat had the potential but it's gonnaPeak at 5 p.m right to 5 a.m and it'slike oh well we can't surf overnight youknow until we bust out the stadiumlights but we're far away from that butthe timing as we watch this live actionof I believe yellow out there that is Ithink it's the shepherdson oh that'swhite excuse me that's white LukeShepherd scent yeah so

and look at that back beerbehind the peak there it's so nuts overthere it is it isthe reason that we're doing this andthat's who we're celebrating The Lifeand Legacy of the Hawaiian water man butwhy Maya continues to perform 10thrunning of the Eddie yeah we gotdropping into this oneand unable to hang on that was TylerLaurent the young man from Mauiyeah a name that some of you might behearing for the first time and that'skind of a lot what we talked aboutearlier what the Eddie is known for toois highlighting these individuals thataren't household pro-surfing names buton this scale in this category it's adifferent side of Surfing yeah talaranactually a second generation Big WaveRider his dad Michelle moved over wasoriginally from France moved to Maui andone was one of the firstyou know kind of that pioneering crewover at jawsoh look at this wave Rocky oh this is amonster holy we got going stroking it tothis one really Billy camper in the loopoh my gosh I saw a splash which I thinkwas his Wipeout and I just got mankindchicken skinoh my goodness that wasthe biggest flavor of the day I think soI think so look at this one one moretakerLuke Shepard said with a giant drop thatpersonout running the Avalanche and heeventually gets eaten up butLuke shepardson doing it again that wasa closeout at the bank well another wayof coming into a third wave of the setthe bay is coming alive it's what timeis it right now Hawaiian Time 11 33the swell could possibly get bigger I'veseen one Eddie canceled or not runbecause it was too big way back in 1998in this month of January I believe itwas uh in 18th or something like that itwas my senior year I skipped school Idon't care I know that day but yeah itwas closing outmassive and too bigwe're kind of right under that thresholdright now I feel like but it'sdefinitely contestable Eddy conditionsBilly Kemper getting the first bomb Lukeshepherdsontaking off on the second wave of thatset and if it's just kind of observing alittle bit it looks like the first wavesof these big sets are the gnarliest bigdrops and then it kind of Smooths outand the second wave Luke was a it was abig wave but the drop didn't look nearlyas hairy as Billy's wave oh boy and aHawaiian water Patrol we got all thecamera angles right now Rocky we've gotwe have uh the Drone angles we have minicameras and I also want to thank uh

again the Surferseight Surfer Heatstwo rounds surf Surfers are able tocatch four waves in each of those Heatsand at the end of the day their topthree wave scores will lead to theirtotal and that's how we establish ourleaderboard and that's I believe thatwas uhMichael and orange or page alms in pinkit's a regular foot yeah it looks likeit was uh I think that's Paigeso we got eyes onthe big wave charger out of Maui andPaige is okay yep water Patrol checkingon herand she's showing some bravado yeah thatwas aincredibly committed drop andwe'll watch the replay of Paige andyou know there's a point where you'relike oh I got this and then it's not ahalf a second later you're underwatergoing oh I don't got it and you saw howfast you got back on her board and waswas okay thankfully there were no wavesbehind that would have uhtrapped her in that little Impact Zonethere so she gets on the board says towater Patrol I'm okay and heads to thechannel and we saw that vision of waterPatrol giving the uhthe signal that she's okay to the restof water Patrol what was that just a tapon the head right touching the head uhlike I'm okayit was a view andaquatic situations that's how you sayyou're okay and why in water Patrol withour Surfers photographers that areactually swimming out there that is oneof the more thanklessjobs I think in our industry of theseguys and girls that swim out there andthe tread water and get these epic shotslooking into the wave yeah we had alittle bit from a Surfline that weplayed earlier of Zack Doyle who in 2016uh swam the whole time oh there's ourbrother right there Cliff bottello wegot you HWP and hfd's finest he hey he'ssaving people whether on the firedepartment or Hawaiian water patrol allangles Captain safety Clifford Botellogreat to see him at the bay yeah it'spretty much all hands on deck forHawaiian water Patrol team they'resummoning you know they're blowing thethe ohepu and the Kong shell across theisland calling them all to converge fromthe East West South and North Shore totake part in this water safety Endeavorso umbrella is like dusting off the dustof the PFD is trying to find it where'smy fin yeah oh whacking the finstogether getting the cobwebs out daddylong legs calling out the thethese guys are the best in the world ohmy goodness and that's where and youknow and actually this group of of waterPatrol guys are the model in which watersafety nowglobally follows the model set byHawaiian water Patrol yeah it's great tosee Hawaiians still innovating andinventing you know even modern day Imean Hawaiians get credited with thesport and active surfing and the Art ofSurfing as well uh you know otherinventions like the near shore fishponds were the first scene here inHawaii so continuing to innovate andinvent our Hawaiians at Hawaiian waterPatrol on the front lines of water andocean safety and as you said settingstandard globally and here's yellowBilly Kemper back out there after agiant Wipeout camper again just findshis way in the scene and gets on thiswave he was on the beach like fourminutes ago and already back out onanother wave he was trying to get his uhvest deflated and here you hear therumble of the crowd anticipating thatShore Break phenomenon hurray that'sbeen of the Eddie the last few times[Applause]Billy wants the short break this one'sgreat good roll through we'll see if itlike barrels at the very end but thisone has so much push behind it it couldjust roll throughand Billy feeling good about that onewhat an effort by Billy Kemper yeah Imean just to be in this event and outthere competing we talked about uh howhe was injured just uhabout a week ago and able to muster upthe courage and it says Mahalo to WaimeaMahalo to Eddie a true warrior standingthere embracing the moment and he'llhave another crack at it too you knowhe's looking down uh he dedicated hisperformance here to his brother thelittle little e Eric Diaz and he knowsright there looking up at Heaven goingEric that's for you man and I oh this isthe chicken style stuff right here man abig late drop for Billy disappears inthe background of that wavethat is in front that's how huge thatsecond wave was and holds on you see theDrone tracking him thereanother disappearing act with the wavein front pumping hopping trying to getthis short break it seems like thisShore Break sand hasn't lined up just asnicely as it would to provide those longextended barrel Closeouts that werewe've seen in the past here we've seen acouple of riders come into the shorebreak like this but it's kind ofbreaking on top of itself with doublesup double ups and triple UPS as Baileyclaims that went to shore rightfully soso maybe later in the day as the sandmoves around we could see moreopportunity for those grand finale ofthe closeout Barrel because I feel likeit's like the the luggage today with youdon't make luggage without wheelsanymore right it's hard to win the Eddiewithout getting a short break bombthat's right and you know what that goesback to 2004 where Bruce irons took awin here at the Eddie and he was reallythe guy that established riding it allthe way into the shore correct and thenever since then that bar has been set offour rides here but it's a dangerous barthat's probably some of the mostdangerous part is right here we goum up and riding Ramon Navarrothe Chilean Sound the Horn so this isgoing to be the lastwavewell it'll be maybe of the heat butthese guys aren't going to stop surfingas the waves keep coming in they're inthe spot you know whether or not theycan even hear the horn sometimes yeahwhen you're way out there in thisoffshore wind and and kind of sidewhipping around it's sometimes in thebay a little bit of an anomaly of wherethe wind's gonna come from it has itsown little micro climate in WaimeaValley and in the bay so depending onwhat direction the wind is blowing andwhen the Surfers may hear the horn ornot the crowd definitely hears the hornand they hear each other cheering onthese big wave Surfers as they competein the Eddyyeah and you know what like you saidthey may hear the horn they may notthey're going to keep on surfing here'sour Heat recap and uh a start of

yellow whiteEli Olson orange Jake Maki the goofyfoot Kai Lenny is out in red and LandonMcNamara in Black this is a stacked teeyeah it is you have two former winnershere at the event and then we have arider up here on a big one that's Landonand the Avalanche eventually consumesLandon McNamara but he makes that bigbig dropyeah amazing Landon we saw in round onehad one of the higher wave scores of theday so I mean he's he's up there I thinkyou last we heard uh he was in thirdplace so he'll want to like add to hisuh quiver of scores and that last onewas a good one yeahI'll look at the leaderboard now I justhad a so we're getting informationum and we will be relaying thatinformation to you so currentleaderboard now we haven't got thetotals from this this heat that we seewalking up the beach but before thisheat we have kailani in first on theleaderboard Ezekiel Lao in second LandonMcNamara in thirdand when we look at the numbers thereIsaiah Landon's low score is on a waveis a 13.5 so that's what he wants tobetter at this point we take top threewaves are these two rounds Landon wantsto better that 13.5 to help himself onthat leaderboard okay well maybe explainwhat is the scale what is the highestnumber you get for a wave the highestnumber you can get for a wave is a 10Point ride but then again we add thethree judges scores together so um sothen you you can get up to a 30. yeahokayand we've seen a couple 30s actually aswe look at the leaderboardI think Landon has one asso Landon McNamara and remember this allthis information is coming purelythrough the coconut Wireless at themomentand Landon McNamara with a 30 as well asuh Ezekiel has a 30. here's a replay ofthe wave of Landon his lastlate drop very steep behind that boilthere you can see so the wave explodesright behind himand he pulls a disappearing actsohere we go and this is going to be areally interesting heat as we can seeright there John John Florence as wellas Eli Olson good friends and Kai Lennyin his first Eddie Akai certainly aforce to be reckoned withevidently yeah and that's just somequiet chat before the nextum set comes throughyeah amazing to have I mean this heatJohn John

others it's awesome timeflying over here you can see the Surfersrepositioning themselves they're on thepaddle right now and being on thatpaddle why Isaiah check out this set ohthey're positioning themselves you cansee they're trying to figure out wherethe right spot is you want to be deepbut not too deep we have a few peopleaiming to catch this one John John wouldgo here he goes John John Florence dropsinto this one long wall in front ofFlorence negotiates that drop handedlylooks like this wave may just uh closeout the bay John John why does he makeit look so casual Isaiah he does and helook he was deeper than everyone he wasinside of everyone too late drop whatjust made it look so smooth and easy hehad a bottom turn on that one that manyof our competitors say you don't reallysee them taking that line because it'sjust about survival but on that last oneJohn John managed to like bottom turn upthe face and ride out over to theshoulder I got my three p's of SurfingIsaiah and it's and it's relevant intoany kind of Surfing but especially inbig wave surfing it's paddleand then perform John John did all threeof those he paddled for that wave he puthimself into position so he could pickthat wave and then he performed justwith such a solid stance and great lineselection thereJohn John Florence of course two-timeWorld Champ uh the defending champ ofthis event that happened seven years agohere at Waimea Bay and he's right backin and uhgreat form look at this wavebeautiful Drop wave barrels out behindhim he's able to come around that whitewatergreat one for John John Florenceanother angle here from behind thesection here you can see him droppingdown a little bit of a chatter on thebottomstand so tall and Casual makes it lookso easyand kicks outactually we are commemoratingcommemorating of course Eddie Aikau atthis event and people would say thatthere was something too like Eddie Icall when he caught the waves he alsohad the ability to make that look easyand able to take off deep in behind thewave and really make him you know makeit look easy and that's that's one ofthe things that our our athletes areum you know that makes an athlete StandOut is their ability to make somethingreally challenging look pretty doableand so these guys make it look reallyeasy getting an update now on ourleaderboard we have Kai Lenny out infirstsecond right now Billy Kemper on thecurrent leaderboard Ezekiel Lao in thirdLandon McNamara in fourth and Lukeshepardson rounding out the top fivethat's our current leaderboard as wekeep you updated and shake the coconuttrees for the coconut Wireless that's acouple of minor birds for theirinformation and we finally get thatstuff to us and we relay it on to to youfolks watching thank you for joining useither on Surfline or locally on K Highand uh it has been an incredible daywe're only halfway through the dayand bring you updated here at the Eddieand it looks like some peopleno better way to watch it well you knowwhat you get the replays if you watch ithere there you go but in person you getto smell and feel the Mana of the oceanoh there's something we're talkingearlier about the Mana of Waimea thevalley and the bay goes back over athousand years to uh it was run byKahuna Nui which is like these highpriests and the Bay has that kind ofAura of Mystique of of Mana this kind ofspiritual energy you have three heyothat are in Waimea and one of thelargest which is up above pupukea thelargest hail or uh kind of like atemple-like structure of of old Hawaiianculture that uh is there at the topthere they say that that heyo had thismystical ability to the the chief of thepriest that was residing there wouldcommunicate with the island of Kauai tothe nearby heyo on the on that islandwhether it's through lighting of firesor through other kind of Supernaturalmeans uh this Hao has a lot of Mana toit and so does the beach here and theocean and we're feeling a all today asthe audience is down there able totestify that the ocean has a lot of Manais it true through that hail and thoseCommunications through the Kahuna is howKamehameha got the news that heyis itthe the king at that time whenit was on on Kauai and and he said ohcool man you know we're going to joinyou guys so we didn't have that thatconquering of quiet you can't you youread all the books I'm just going tovote by Legend right now yeah well theuh they're kind of cool too is Heatherhevel is the name of his high priest ofkamehameha's high priest that would makethese calls they would sometimes say youknow the they would read you know theelements uh and and interpret you knowwhat the signs or the uh the Hawaii Lonaare saying and and these these advisorswould say hey don't go into battle atthis time go in the middle of the day ordon't go to battle here and and so yeahso that was the job of the priests andhave a heva who by the way is theancestor or kupuna of the iCal family soreally interesting that communicationthat connection but yeah certainly thethe you're right Kamehameha chose not togo to war against Kauai and they insteadmade a treaty with each other withoutWar Bloodshed yeah and then the folks atKauai join the rest of us gang over hereand uniting under one Hawaiian KingdomUnder Kamehameha is this correct correctyeah and so one of the final battlestook place on this island here we'relooking at Oahu and over toward the eastside where we have this battle at nuuanuoh that was a brutal one wasn't it rightI mean Kamehameha brought his men up theshores in Honolulu pushing uh the theOahu Warriors to the edge of literallythe cliff on the precipice at nuwanutoday called the Pali lookout and that'swhere hundreds of Warriors fell to theirdeath rightkind of cool Jason Momoa is actuallyplaying there there's an Apple TV seriescoming up where they're telling thisstory of this battlesum and one of the Chiefs that actuallyJason Momoa is playing is is Kayana andKayana is the one of the chiefly figuresthat originally is with Kamehameha inhis uh in his on his army but then theyhave a kind of a falling out and in theand it climaxes at this battle of newone so it's going to be a really epicSeries yeah that was a great story I washoping for Jason Momoa to ring me up aslike a role as a warrior but I guess Ididn't make the the warrior cut in thatupcoming film but I'll be watching itbut uhall right so getting you caught back upin the action here this is heat oneround number two it's been pumping allday we've been listening to Surfline ourofficial forecaster for the Eddie theytold us that this swell would peek rightduring kind of midday into the afternoonand we started off with big ymail butnow Isaiah we're seeingwe're seeing some near closeout sets Iknow this one's a Luke shepardson hadand Billy Kemper and that last Heatthose were maxing out so it's excitingfor us to watch and I'm sure verynerve-wracking for our contestantsanother set coming through here andwe'll see if we have any takers on thethird wave of the set the first two kindof roll under all of our competitors ourcompetitorspositioning themselves we got a paddlehereand ohyeahoh I can say is wow that was a a bigsteep drop to be had and it looked likewe had two Surfers paddling for that oneEli Olson and John John 4 and some oldfriends scratching it to this one JohnJohn says he wants it Eli right in frontof him and the two friends are gonnashare a wave at the baythat is just poetry in surfing WaimeaEli Olson John John Florence againmaking it look easyso fun to watch that and make againhaving these two friends they're almostlike brothers sharing a wave together atWaimea very steep late drop that's whatmakes it exciting the fact that JohnJohn was able to make that being deeperin the peak shows that probably thevalue will go a little bit more tobecause he was in the more critical partof the wave but man some big waves todaythere's a famous image of Eddie ikawthat really put him on the map this wasin 1967 or 68 where he's taking off on awave similar to some of these bigcloseout ways there's John John Florenceand Eli Olsonlove these guys and uh you know they gotthey got their out there they'reum John John got his I'm sure it's apiezel padlock he's you know a guy who'sstuck with his shaper since whatever 10years of age oh one more look at thisIsaiah yeah I can see howdrops in the way under the sea level andthe two right there's a water angle lookat how late he is turns the board rightas he's dropping in so he doesn't getthrown over the fallsbeautiful waveyou know I noticed he's writing a redboard which is I don't know if it's anhomage to Eddie because Eddie was knownfor his red board and catching thesemassive waves in the 60s and 70s I usedto talk to some big Wave Riders who I'mjust fortunate to have in my life andfamily and some uncles and KimoHollinger who's a North Shore PioneerHawaiian Big Wave Rider he told me healways liked the colored boardsespecially red boards and stuff becausea lot of those guys didn't have leashesback then so you could see a red boardin this foamy White Water like this fareasier than you could see a white boardso the red board had like a also hadalmost a function to it by having thecolor on the board so you can find ityou know in a sea of whitecan you imagine I mean today we're we'reblessed with um we have the water skithe jet ski to be there to rescue wehave inflatable suits we have leashesand so much technologyI mean when during Eddie's time when hewas surfing the bay they didn't evenhave leashes let alone any of thoseother things yeah and you know what wemade an announcement earlier and wewanted to say aloha oi and ourcondolences and prayers to the currentfamily Pat Curran are going to heaventoday an originalum Waimeaa surfer one of the Pioneers out hereand I think you know maybe some uh Pat'senergy and light is shining down on thisswellyeahRicky Grigg and Greg Knoll and youmentioned chemo Hollinger which isimportant to know that they were a mixof Hawaiian and Californian surferssurfing back in those times I mentionedearlierour condolence is also to the Aikaufamilywas passing recently and so we'rededicating this event also to Saulum who passed recently as wellyeah a lot of energy a lot of moneycoming into that's what makes this souniqueas we see this is going to bethinking about thiswave here we go[Music][Applause][Music]we gotta ID them and we'll get anotherangle on it so we can uh check it outbut here we go Isaiah we're kicking itinto another gear here at Waimea anotherset coming through this frequency of thestep sets seem to be increasing as welloh my goodness watch that wave justunload and Barrel looked like it wasgonna spit on the end which is somethingyou'd see more at pipeline but Waimea isdelivering some powerful waves todaykailani repositioning as we fly up aboveand so maybe that was Kai on that thatlast wave that came through he looksenergized this is Jake Maki on theinside that's the orange jersey for thegoofy foot teenager from the North Shorehaving to jump off his boardleash test time for Makithe young guysfrom the nearby here on the North Shoregraduated from Kahuku High SchoolJake's one of those kids too that youknow the the legendary continuation ofBig Wave Riders born and bred on theNorth Shore is just this place you knowwe have people who who spend theirentire life trying to get here and theytrain here and they come here every yearbut the Homegrown Talent imagine someonelike a young Jake who's just this hasbeen his backyard for as long as he'sknown right right yeahthere's a replay of this oneand that is Jake's wavedid a great job of re-emerging out ofthat incredible bombing wave that blewup right behind him right here boomdisappears re-emerges does the Houdiniact and that'll be a great way for hisscore Line This is where we have the twoRiders up both of them up both of themdisappearyeah so that looks like it was AaronGold behindumone by Reno abalero remember kailani'son top of the leaderboard right now soa lot of things can change we've seenthat in every uh you know we've seenthat at every Eddy we can look back justto you know 2009 with the one of thelast waves of the event Greg Long tookthat leaderboard off of the hands ofKelly Slater Kelly wanted to make it twoKelly Slater winning in 2002. he wasleadingin that final heat in 2009 when GregLong caught that bomb at Waimea changedthe scene and put his name on notice tothe big wave community and really youknow started the career of Greg longwith that 2009 Eddie win yeah that wasamazing well we're gonna have to go to acommercial right now to thank oursponsors and we appreciate all of oursponsors we'll be right back with theconclusion

crowd on the beach many of thesepeople slept here camped here for atleast a day or two just to be able to beon the spot here on the sand to watchthis live action the waves are pumpingwe have a guest with us here Dr Joshstoppa whose uh works at the Universityof Hawaii as a professor in Ocean andresource engineering program he studieshe studies of courseCoastal management but also the part ofthat process is understanding wave andclimate and welcome and thank you forjoining us Justin yeah thanks for havingme so being the expert as an engineerand uh with a PhD and we've we'recolleagues of sorts you know we've uhI've been able to join you in your classbefore and as a guest visitor and so butwe have you know you're you're here toum you're an expertise is is also withunderstanding this swell and how totrack it so that's really outside of myrealm as a historianumwe're gonna see if there's a wave riddenbut when we cut after this wave youcould maybe tell us a little bit more ofthe science behind this swell and whatwe're seeing here at Waimea Bay todayyeah certainly here we goum well this this event in particular isnot uh so unique in its strength butwhat it it's very unique with itsposition in proximity to Hawaii that'swhy it's so big the waves are so bigtoday all right so oh my goodnessspeaking of big waves here we have arider up going backside riding thisbehind the curtains able to emergethrough the foamyou can do itsee if we can ride through this nextsection[Music]that is Landon McNamara who's had acouple of really good ways one in fact aperfect score earlier in round one lookslike he's gonna ride this one in throughthe inside[Music][Applause]so Justin in other words we um as we'rewatching Landon ride through on thisinside section through the shore breakthe swell is Big today not necessarilybecause the size of the storm but itsproximity to us here on the North Shoreyeah that's correct it's actually verysimilar to the 2002 event the stormtrack and the proximity and the strengthof the storm were very similarwhereas in 2016 you'd say the storm wasa lot biggerthat that storm was Stronger probablybut in further away okay but it had amuch more magnitude in the winds ininside the generation of the storm andthat created similar size waves as todaynow to our viewers maybe you couldexplain how is that we can predict whatis the science of knowing and predictingthese swells I know we have buoys and wehave other kind of forecasting but whatelse goes into the process of predictingyou know because we we almost ran theEddy last week and we decided not to andwhat is it that they're watching forthat can predict these events beforethey actually take place well the theWorkhorse behind a lot of it ismathematical models that's the onlything that really gives us forecasts andif we have a good wind forecast we canrun that through our mathematical modelsall right we're going to watch thisreplay real quick this is of LandonMcNamaragets around that section rides throughthe foam and this is the one he takes itall the way to shorelook at the sides of that whitewashthat's not something you'd normally wantto catch in whitewash but my goodnesshe's doing his best to stay hanging onto that oneso sorry I interrupted you um tell us alittle bit moreso at this particular event I waswatching it about a week ago and theforecast was changing quite a bit whichusually means that there's uncertaintyin in some part of the storm rather themagnitude of the track and then it kindof settled down about four days ago inthe in the forecast was consistent whatwas really good yesterday aboutum yesterday there was a satellite thatpassed over overhead of the storm andthat was 46 feet measured by a satellitealtimeter so that for me was like thefirst confirmation that the waves wereactually that bigwow yeah and I know um you know we havecompetitors that are we have to givethem advance notice and it's not alwayseasy to do especially if and it seemedlike with this well as I was watching ittoo on Surfline that it seemed to changequite a bit and so it wasn't as you'resaying until we had that imagery was ityesterday you said that just uhyesterday afternoon we got a direct hitwith an altimeter the previous days theykept missing the storm becauseum these these satellites don't alwayscross overhead of the event of the peaksoum what do we what can we expect for theremainder of the day yeah so there's abuoy Northwest of Kauai uh run by thenational data buoy Center 51001 and thatgives us about a four to five hourumlook into the future so the waves thereum this morning it was about at 7 30 itwas about 25 feet and that looks like itwas the biggest so far so we can expectthat in about an hour look I think thenthere might be a little bit of a lulland then it almost is consistent uhmaybe 24 feet again that's offshore ofKauai so here you can expect maybecloser to that closeout we saw earlier Ithink we'll see more waves like that inabout an hour and a halfyeah I mean what's really nice we weretalking earlier during the breakum that it's not just about the size ofthis wall but it's the timing of itright because a swell will Peak andsometimes if it peaks in the middle ofthe night or early in the morning thenit doesn't really offer a full day ofcompetition but it seems like this onehas the right timing with us and it'sperfect right it started this morning 7A.M and just got bigger throughout theday sothe other thing interesting with thiswell since it was so close to us here inHawaii there's a Broadband range offrequencies or wave periods and this isuh means the waves will be reallyconsistent but sometimes it's a littleShifty and I think you can see that withthe competitorsso so you're saying because it's closeand the shiftiness that it it may makeit more challenging to pick the rightone right and even on the buoy now youcan see some periods are about 21seconds and then it goes down even about16 seconds so it's a pretty large rangeof uh wave periodsSo when you say Shifty what do you meanby thatumjust when these different wave periodsum interact with each other you can geta peak that starts moving a bit I thinkyou can see some of that on the biggestwaves herewell um do you have somebody a favoritethat you're rooting for today in thisevent uh there it's just great to watcheverybody I don't have a favoriteall right well uh Justin a professorfrom the University of Hawaii at Manoauh got his PhD from there and Manoa aswell and thank you for joining usappreciate your time and being here withus in the booth yeah thank you alohapossible donations going through anincredible causethe memory the legend the inspiration ofthe Eddie I call alive well as you cansee our lineup is taking a little bit ofa break and our competitors are sittingin the lineup waiting for the rightplace to be as we heard our professorstoppa explain that sometimes the withthis interval uh swell that with a closestorm that the the peak can be a littleShifty in understanding where to sit issometimes not as certainon this board20 years agoone of her stretch out of Santa Cruz andagain dedicating this event of course toEddie ikaw and his legacy and surfingWaimea Bay and when he was 21 years oldcouplehe was that was where he got this bigswell and there's a very famous photo ofhim taking off on one of these thatlooked like a closeout took off behindthe peak and you can see him with areally solid wide stance angling knifinginto the wave but you can see the peakin front of him that wavebasically made Eddie famous and this wasactually this one year he had quite theyear where he made it to the finals inthe Duke Invitational competitionwas known for surfing one of the biggestdays at the bay and getting the bestshot of that day and then that at theend of that year he got the call to bethe first lifeguard at Waimea Bay atthis beach yeah um and so in that oneyear really was like a big big year forhim and and since then and and then forthe next remainder of those few years hecontinued surfing in competition and uhand the bay became sort of his spotespecially as he was posted up here asthe Lifeguard the first lifeguard aswell at Waimea baby because it was sucha dangerous and treacherous place to bethat they wanted their most trustingindividuals to be there and he did hisjob incredibly they said under his watchnot one person lost their life yeahincredible and the celebration of TheLife and Legacy of Eddie Aikau and youtalk about treacherous Waimea and we'reseeing some of why man's treachery rightnow as this set rolls through we sawthat first wave of the set no one ableto paddle into that one offshore winsanother big big waveraises to the Horizon big drop herelining this one upand it looks likehi Lennygetting exploded there on the bottom ifI'm correct he uh we lost some in thetrough for a second from our visionhere we gobig drop there for blue Aaron Goldand both Surfersunable to withstand the mountain ofwhite water that has encompassed thembut a great effort by both of thoseSurfersyeah kyleni as you mentioned earlier inround one he was the top of ourleaderboard and he's still staying busyand active and as you said earlier in2009 when when umwhen Kelly Slater was in the leadthroughout most of the day it's not overuntil all the Heats are done so um soKai still got some work to do to keep onthere we go here's this angle of fromthe Drone Kai Lenny making that dropcomes around that explodes behind him heactually does reappear and afterwardswhere he loses his footing and hisbalance there's a water angle of it lookat the size of that waveright here it explodes right behind himand still rides through that section soI think that hopefully will be a keeperfor him and put it into his cuethat was it was hey um I just want tosay something for all this coverage aseveryone's who who can't make it down tothe beach like these thousands of peoplefor those of you who are enjoying thison Surfline as well as K High I want tothank Eddie he and Sean Keely JustinAguilaruh writer YamamotoDave Yamagata and Stephen tercino someof the crew there at K2khon2 and K High uh for all of theirefforts that they've put in here and umHawaiian telecom for their support aswell thank you to the entire crew uhChristina and the crew over there atkhon2 for making all this possibleIsaiah this was a fire drill if you willwe don't have you know a lot of a lot ofplanning that we're able to do we hearthe swallows coming there's speculationyou don't know if it's going to go andthen within the last I want to say36 to 48 hourseveryone's had to scramble together tomake this show possibleand so Mahalo big mahalas to everybodyin their teams they're getting and it'sthe you know the ocean right it's younever know exactly what it's going toturn out to we had Dr stoppo explainingthat they we didn't know until lastnight precisely how powerful this stormwas or yesterday afternoon when asatellite flew right over the storm andwas able to confirm that they had45-foot waves coming and soit's you never it's very makes itchallenging in our sport to adjustbecause there's like you said thereisn't really that window that gives ussomething that we can always plan foryeah County Downing 1990 Eddie winner uhhad a famous quote to meet keone being amentor of mine where he saidI don't get excited till it hits thebuoys that's when I know it's real whenthose buoys start moving those Noahbuoys that we have out in the Pacificthat move with the swells and give us aphysical reading of the swell then wecan really count on that as the actualswallow a lot of it is the science of Ithink you guys talked about the scienceof forecasting but a lot of that arecomputer models correct correct I'lltell you right yeah and even um I meanJustin was saying too it wasn'twe like you said you know the physicalmanifestation of the buoys we had thereadings this morning the buoys off ofKauai and once you get those readingsYou can predict with a lot more accuracyof exactly what time it Peaks and soforth and so he was saying that um we'regoing to see some more closeout setstoday and then it may take a little lulland then the afternoon we're gonna seethat same amount of pulse of these bigswells coming to us yeah so we can seewith the buoy readings and I don't itdepends on the swell angle but I believeit's any it's uh about 12 hours or soand even varying about the swell anglecorrect correct and so you can see whenthe buoys go down that's when we have alittle breather in the swell but I guessthe buoys pop back up right rightyeah so so great to have Justin herefrom uh moneyline great to have you hereas well at Dr Isaiah walker uh Isaiah isa what you teach at BYU but what's youractual subjects that you teach uh yeahso I'm a professor of History I got aPhD at UC Santa Barbaraand I've been a professor at BYU Hawaiiin the history department for the lastuh 16 17 years actuallyuh recently I'm I'm in administrationright now so my title right now is anacademic vice president at BYU Hawaiilike the shout out to all of our localkids to keep us on the map to all rightconsider BYU Hawaii as an option for youwe have a lot of great programs but uhyes I teach history world history that'sright Hawaiian history hey no no need togo Mainland right stay at home and Momand Dad the rent is free and go to BYUuh the best kept secret it's a smallschoolum but uh I mean on the North Shore Icame here actually from Hilo group andHilo went to school by Hawaii as afreshman I was like brah like 15 minutesfrom VLAN[Laughter]yeah it's it's a great place and uh andwe celebrate that for sureaction in the water right here with alittle bitlittle bit of slips underneath ourcompetitorsin this first heat of round two againround robin format two rounds surf byeach of our Heats eight Surfer Heatsout of those and four waves maximumridden in each of the Heats so out ofthose eight waves you take your topthree wave scores add those together andthat's how we get our leaderboard andthat's how we're gonna Crown a champdefending champJohn John Florence currently out in thewater in the yellow Jersey he wants totake that top spot again rightso if you're interested in learning moreabout Duke Kahanamoku I recommend StuartHolmes Coleman wrote a book called Eddiewould goes but over 20 years ago did areally good job in that piecewaves of resistance it's a book that Iauthored a few years back that talks abit about Hawaii and the North Shore andand Eddie Aiko as well so it's reallygreat that we we have this Legacy ofsurfers and Hawaiian history and that'slike you're saying earlier that this isone thing really cool and unique aboutthis particular event that it's not justcelebrating the current wave action butthis Legacy and this tradition ofSurfing that's taking place forthousands of years and for it to be hereat Waimea Bay and the valley of thisvery powerful and historicallysignificant place just adds to that Manayeah and and I'm and I'm feeling it andyou can see the Gathering there a lot ofpeople you may be uh messaging me dmingme I got you guys I'm trying to get youguys scores okay but this is Hawaiiankind and I'm waiting for an update fromthe beach and sometimes we gotta use thecoconut Wireless so I apologize for thatwe're going to keep on updating you assoon as we get them they'll be umverbally we're gonna tell you the scoresand the leaderboard that is our capacityright here uh so uhexcuse me but we're gonna get itmeans to waitso here we go uh as we see the orangecaution tape by our city and countylifeguards corralling off the peoplefrom the beach which is a reallyimportant aspect because North Shore ofOahu you can have these times wherethere's nothing going on it looks safeit looks it looks almost inviting andthose are just lulls because before youknow it that flat ocean right thereturns intoan extremely dangerous place with waveheights on the face up to 40 50 feet butthe calm is what tricks people Isaiahright yeah and that's what it keeps ourlifeguards really busyin fact we talk about Eddie ikaw as alifeguard and he had a philosophy oflike you've got to warn them before theyget into this situation it's thepreemptive stuff that really makes adifference so he's really good at likeencouraging people not to go near thewater line because it'll sweep you offyour feet and then drag you out into theocean and there's a very strong currentthere you can see as evidence with thatchop and all that water moving aroundthat our jet skis are trying to you knowmanage so you're right it's easy toassume that there's a there's a safetime because the waves are are taking abreak but they're coming backon that series of close out sense theregoes the Hawaiian water Patrol had ashot of the tower there uh that's anewer Tower and Eddie's day there wasn'tair conditioning and yeah on that bigreinforced concrete pole as well pillarif you wouldscratching scratching go ohLandon McNamara taking a look at thatone wanted it badly just couldn't get inand under the lipskis getting out of the way as a massiveset hits here without we talking abouthow it goes from calm to extreme giantdrops tippy toes making it to the bottomEli Olson ohand here two Riders to zero riders thatwas a bomb I'm thinking that was EliOlson and Jake Maki on that wavehere we go one moregiant Trump and I'm gonna make it to thebottom look like Alan gold on that onegoodness we'll get that in the replay toget a closer up but that was action moresets coming lining up across the baythis one looks like it's gonna take outthe entire lineupand likely connect to the left acrossthe bay Hawaiian water Patrol surveyingthe destruction on the inside and itlooks like umthat was white Eli Olson said he's okayflying above here you can see therepositioning and what a scoop right nowgetting Eli on the back of that ski andout of the waymay have broken a leash we'll see ifhe's still got his board with him gotthe board nopeno that's just the Escape escapingand with that throttle right there thatcould be keone Carolina one of thefastest ski driversin the worldhe likes the throttlelook at this big wayit's amazing why may I be one thingthat's really distinguishes this waveand the way that it breaks is there'spart of it right where the lip hitsusually a wave will explode and thenkind of shoot up and a little bit up butthat last one that we sawit shot out like 50 feet to the frontand when you're riding a wave and likeyou got what seems like a fire hoseshooting you from behind it's very hardto maintain your stance and posture lookat this drill right now by Hawaii waterPatrol they're gonna have to zigzaginside of the surf line right nowbecause there's no way I look like thechannelum if the channel has been taken out soyou can see these guys zigzagging herechecking on the competitorslooks like that's going to be blue AaronGold he's going to get on the sled I wastrying to do the pickupand just missing them sokeeping a watchful eye Hawaiian waterPatrol Eli Olson you can see him toothey've been taking quite a few wavesum with the rest of the set Isaiah yeahwe call that in surfing getting caughtinside where you're unable to avoid thewave and there's nothing you can do butjusttake it on the head and oftentimes hearof course maybe we'll see this you ditchyour board go under it this close toshore soexplosion on the shore breakso also this that means these Surfershave had to take numerous waves on thehead and have been pushed near the shorebreak after basically getting explodedafter the takeoffokay so 10 secondsuh let's check this out let's check whatwhat the decision time isand that's just uh coming in he's okayall right good signthat's Landon McNamarayeahwe took five or six monstrous waves onthe head and of course you have to holdyour breath each timeit looks like he also took his his leashoff look at this replay here Don JohnFlorence this is a Heat recapyeah that was John John Florence andJake Maki on that giant wave going allthe way across the baycheck this one out four three beautifulones looks like Greg Long yeah Greg longwith a nice drop staying in controlthereone more view this time of LandonMcNamara on the backhandbehind that boil and that white watchesengulfed himJohn John Florence making it look EasyAir dropping into this huge wave JohnJohn had a really good heat in thisround I got a couple of keeper scores soI think that'll really help him on theleaderboard Here Comes Jake grabbingrail off to take offand trying to outrun that explosion doessoon this was Landon again caught a coupleof really good rides in this wave andthis heat excuse memade it around that onewe also saw him on that last Heat

it is uh it's the best bigwave Surfers in the world but then againit's Invitational so you can't you knownobody can just enter you have to beinvited just to get invited to thisevent is the honor in itself yeah andyou know the alternate list you look atwho's on that list it is an amazingcollection of big wave Surfers and we'vehad a couple of them get into this eventtoday uh due to uh injury we've alsoseen in the past uh especially with ourInternational Surfers sometimes hard tomake the logistics of getting here tothe Bay when it's called on here we goit's on for our Surfer in Orangethat looks like tile Shipman once againpossiblyorange pink or red pick a color andstick with it butlots of tents lots of people they'vebeen here since last night yesterdayeven and then just hey hoarding to thebeach this morning a lot of peoplecamping over there in the bushes on topof the cliff look at you guys No need noneed permit everybody just charged it ohbro it's just the Eddie permit anythinggoes Eddie would go and anything goesthat's pretty much the Mantra when it'sa day like today hey my Mantra is uhpleaseand pick up all of your rubbish pick upall of your Apollo everybody that'scoming down to the beach on the cliffsin the bushes whatevergather more trash than you even broughtso this is this is for next year becauseyou guys can't hear us on the beach butyeah when do you guys come down ah whenyou watch it later because we're gonnahave the uh replay yeah this evening onkhon2 uh we're gonna have the replay sowhen you get back homeand you hear it yeah it just should beevery day you know what I mean we areone ocean that's uh I'm wearing my hatbecause that's my cause we are one oceanas we see the ocean folding over at thetakeoff Zone yeah we've yet to see agoofy foot winner at this Eddie in areallytrying to see if this is theBreakthrough year for a goofy foot we'veseen landed McNamara get some bombs he'suh checked in all of his scores and wesaw a pair of goofy Footers there Ithink that was Mark Healy and ColeRothman yep uh yep uh orit could have been Nick von Rupp too inthe white jersey but so do we do haveeight Surfers out there and it lookslike we have one two three of them beinggoofy foot score Rothman Mark Healy andNick von Rupp and just quickly back toyour mention I love the message ofpicking up your trash because you're soright it is doesn't matter whose it isit is all ours as we see Nick von Ruppin the white in front of KOA Rothmanwho's in the blue so a pair of goofyfoots sharing a wave at Waimea on theirbackhand yeah so we talk about thejudging Rocky I would I would think thatCole is going to get the higher scoreout of the two he was deeper on the wavein a more critical section correct yesand that'salmost what you can guarantee uh if twoSurfers ride the wave equally the deeperSurfer will get a little notch or anudge in the score rightthat is the the more critical point ofthe wave to be in as you uh soeloquently mentioned just a minute agoand uh steep deep and underneath staysteep deep underneath and there is theriver over at White stay patient in thetraffic and it's going to be one ofthose days only one way in actually twoways out yeah you go around the islandtwo ways but right you're gonna end upin the same place because it's an islandyeahyeah it's going to be difficult to findyourself in a different location drivingaround in a circle but that highwayright there and that bridge is justgoing to be a choke point for the entireIsland todayand there you can see look at the thewater like you talked before coming fromthe ocean connecting to the river rightover that berm yeah you don't want to bea river roller we've seen those beforeuh not expecting to get wet dry clotheson backpack aerating yeah yard salethere goes a cell phone and then uh butthat sand is also super deep so it's notlike you can like fully Sprint throughit it's uh one step and you're like upto your knees so you gotta really planit well with your timing and Crossingthat very low-lying Point watching outfor those big sets washing over yeahRocky look at these big sets comingright now you know summertime we havethe the Fourth of July paddle racesputs on and the final thing after you doyour long paddle from Sunset or TurtleBay all the way who I miss you I gottarun up that soft sand in the healingyeah that's the killer I've seen guys gofrom first place to last place thatwould be menot easy that run up the beach you can'tpaddle fast but you gotta run in the endwell here we go flying up above lots ofwhite water and still some jocking ofpositioning out in the lineup in thisheat two of round two no priority we weshould bring up as well is you know it'spositioning that gives you the right ofway and the kind of camaraderie uhgentleman gentlewoman type of uhpriority positioning kind of you knowback to the old school and the wayWaimea I think was intended to be surfedfrom the very beginning and I think allspots kind of in that way but we aretaking a step away from our conventionalcriteria and and format with thisnon-eliminationnon-priority and pretty muchnon-interference yeah but that'spriority every day even free surfing youknow if you're deepwhy are you paddling on the shoulderjust knowing that the guys already gotit right you know because I know hey wewelcome everybody you might Pearl thoughwhen people come oh he's got a checkthat's it yeah I check but don't butdon't go but don't go yeah just justbring some etiquette and some some youknow some of the Unwritten rules that wehave in surfing because we've had alarge surf audience join us in the lastI want to say decade and even more so inthe last couple of years exactly sowe'll see a writerdropping into this one and who are wegonna go with thereI'll let you go Rocky I'm good yeahthank youshipment on that one what do you think Ithought maybe Zeke loud[Music]I'll pass it to you nowhere's the ropewe're having a good time we are EzekielEzekiel out 29 years old HawaiianKamehameha schools and the good news isRocky we're gonna see Ezekiel Lau backon the championship tour we'll kick offthe tour here we go yeah nice late dropthere for Zeke really casual lookingmade it look a little easier than itactually was survives thatgnarly white water that I heard Isaiahmention earlier shoots outwards into theflats which is kind of uh unique toWaimea Bay I feel like or some of theselarger waves or these big wave surfspots where the explosion doesn't gohigh in the air as Zeke yeah he has asmoking not a super wide grin he wantsto get one of those grinners that hecaught earlier this morning of a hugelate drop I think he got a near perfectscore on that yeah ezekielauumriding his 10-0 Wade to Coral gun andthis is ezekiel's first Eddie so youknow a really honor for any Surfer butespecially for Hawaiian Surfers you knowto get invited into this event yeah andand then the invitation happensand then it's like you do the openingceremony but then it's still likeanothernotch or another step to reach is itactually runs and so you can be invitedyears in a row without it running butthennow we're we're scratching the sevenyear Eddie itch with the 2023 happeningin ezekielau finally gets his chanceyeah and and it deserve it inviting intothe yetibeautiful afternoon and it's we've beenvery fortunate that these offshore windshave continued to just stick around forus looks like Mason ho with his PatRawson gun getting ready for his go outfrom this angle he looks like a Menehunecompetitor like he's just got thatyouthful like aura about him and whenhe's looking that way and his long hairand stuff I was likewho who what's the kid down thereholding Mason's board for him yeahand making sure double not that buggeryeah right there you know like losethose on top national TVhey you got something to talk about isright you got to keep your shorts on andwhen everything's going every differentdirection it is uh something to payattention to yeah if you're not wearinga wetsuit you definitely want to keepthose buggers double knotted yeah and umaround your waist so Mason hoe gettingready for his next Heat number threecoming up Mason ho 34 years old butstill really you know that men who knowthat Grom in heart like yeah one of themost entertaining I've said it beforeI'll say it again one of the mostentertaining Surfers in the entire worldwhen it just comes to like you want towatch someone surf so that's going to beawesome Mason's gonna Mason's gonnaentertain you no matter what the wave iswhere it is he is a creative genius whenit comes to wave riding I love itnotice he has the quad fin on his gunyeah you know and I was curious aboutsome of the differences in choices forour Surfers uh we may even possiblystill have one of those OG traditionalSingle Fin Riders at the bay we haveEmily Erickson is out there on her uhRyan Carlson singlefin her Old Faithfulshe's uh Emily's out there so you seethe that's the design change you gotsomeone handling out on a quad but yeahright now in a heat you have atraditional Single Fin gun out in thelineup right and and I think that'spart of the beauty of this event as wellas the equipmentchoices progressions but also Throwbacksand uh sticking to some traditionalstylesincorporating all of that in this singleevent is what makes this very specialso still on the standby for any kind ofuminformationthere's a high washer right there that'sa toe ticklerreaching up the shoreline right thereover the bermyeah so next Heat we got Justine DupontCala Kenley Shane Dorian heartMalaLucas shanka Mason Hall and Peter Melhere we go live action and just gettinga little bit hitting some speed bumpstoward the edge that looked like thatwas uhPradaJamie O'Brien did I look like blackhe's really digging in his Rail and uhlooking for that big bottom turn butcouldn't quite bring it back down as wewatched live action for yellow Fletcherall right Nate Dogg getting one outthere as wellyou talk about Nathan Fletcher 34 yearsold lives on the North Shore noworiginally from San Clemente CaliforniaNathan Fletcher part of that FletcherOhana that Fletcher family father Herbiereally put together as a Pioneer here onthe North Shoreuminvented Traction in the way of Astrodeck yeah and really brought you knowwhen we talk about safety and jet skisand stuff really one of the first guysto bring the jet sea ski into the surfyeah and maneuvering it and doing thosekinds of things on the backhand righthere looks like Mark Healy in the purpleso Healy with a big drop and a big bigbunch of white water behind him firmstands for Mark Healey and he is goingto maintain a finish right behind himdropping into this one getting to thebottom that's going to be Nick von Ruppout of Portugalyeah Nick making it to thatopen face on the inside section thereand trying to stay close to the whitewater for a possible kind of length ofrideShore Break extension possibilitywe've seen that occur just a few timestodayand it really comes with being able todraw that right line and keep with ithe's trying to pump and stay with itlooks like it's going to fade out andnot let themall the way into the shore break thatprobably could be a blessing in disguiseyeah so I shook the coconut tree in thein the hey here's our latestbring them all bring them home here wego here's the latest in the leaderboardand we got a big change on top numberone right nowJohn John Florence has taken the lead onthe leaderboardKai Lenny currently in second placeLandon McNamara in third Billy Kemper infourth so John John he's done surfingfor today will he hold on to that topposition well he's our defending champlooking to be our first ever two-timeand back to back that would be quite thestory yeah sooh gosh he's got a perfect wave a 30 and28.7 25.5 he's he does have a lead onthe rest of the pack Rockyum but we never like to speak too soonwe got lots of Surfing going on and ourfriends at Surfline tell us that theyshould pulse through the afternoon righthere we have this uh replayup and down that was j.o.bjust behind the little boil therefurther on the inside looks like hisfoot kind of slipped off the back as wewatch yellowthat is Nathan Fletcherand Nathan kicks out he hadone of the most horrendous waves I'veever seen atchopo that was justput him on the map as one of thecraziest individuals on the planet yeahNathan Fletcher complimentsMark Healey right there Healy uhsurvives a big mountain of white wateryeah Nathan Fletcher I meangiant waves I mean the guys jumped outof a helicopter onto a wave yeahprettyall aroundtalented guy but definitely pushinglimits on all frontshere we go with Hawaiian water Patroltalk to us about this dance to getthrough the white water and the shorebreak oh man it is such a a delicate yetroughexistence to be operating a jet ski inthese conditionsnot only responsible for the lives ofothers but responsible for an expensivepiece of equipment and your own life ontop of it all it is uh and then you knowperforming Under Pressure there's anaudience right you can't deny thespectacle that is surrounding you whenyou look up and you're on the ski inthere you look up to the every inch ofland is covered by a person what kind ofproblem can all this white water presentfor a jet ski when we talk about theimpeller and the propulsion of that wellit does have to uhsuck up the water to get propulsion andto get the into the impeller and the Jetandit only functions with water right itdoes not function well when it sucks upair or foam and that will cause it I'veheard the word cavity uh basically it'slike a misfire when you're pulling thethrottle it's revving but you're notgoing anywhere and nothing's happeningas far as Forward Motion so very trickyto operate in these conditions it's verytricky to operate that high in the lipand air dropswowthat's how shipment going for it youcould see him getting hung up in the lipby the offshore wind and unable to getthe inertia that it would take to getdown that wave faceyou know I'm not sure if you knowsometimes you stop paddling too soon orI heardum Twiggy explained sometimes thatthere's a little current actuallypulling up the face or some water movingagainst you with the wind you pair thattogether that's just not auh positive equation for your big waveendeavoryeah we had a talk and we had a piecewith Brock little talking about hiscloseout wave that he caught at the Bayof legendary wave and how he couldn'tget down to face at all because it wasso much water moving up the face here'sa replay he's trying to go like down anup escalator right therethere's a water angle of tile juststroking into it gets to his feet andthen is a little hung up just thatlittle separation of the board from thewave creates that slippage off the frontyou saw his front foot kind of slidealmost did the splits as he was goinginto the water so it was uhdo you want to elevate a little bitscary for a moment there I'm sure fortile but he looks to be up and okay withbombs out the back oh my here we go youcan see him coming and the guys outthere in the lineup they can see himcoming the crowd feels it on the beachthey're starting to cheeroh this is a big set Rocky oh manis it gonna take out the entire lineuppossibly is anyone going to spin on thiswave who's in positionjet ski trails over the shoulders ofthese waves tells you they're on themove as welloh my ohoh markoh that was Mark Healy just floating andflutteringmy goodness on a 50-foot face oh geezone more let's see if we got any takershere there's just like too much waterdrawing I don't know if that's one'seven possible riding right I know likeyou need likego go gadget arms to be able to get intothat like with you know orangutan armsor something like it's just almostimpossible to paddle in from where thoseSurfers were how deep they were andsometimes I almost feel like on a on areal concave cupped out Giant Wave likethat it turns to physics in a wayit's you know the inertia it takes toactually catch it and then stand up andget down the wave face it'smathematically not possible at time attimes paper yeah I'm not Professor butum yeah that's what you're saying youknowand and some of these big boards wetalked about a little earlier withIsaiah is likeeven though the wave is huge it stillhas a hard time fitting a 10 foot boardinto the Contour right of some of thesewaves so you factor in so many variablesof what can go wrong and uh just likethe Eddie needs everything to go rightto have this event the surfer iscatching these waves need just as muchto go right to be able to make it downthe face isn't it true you have to befor far enough in so that you can catchthe wave but you have to start paddlingsoon enough to get enough of that wholespeed to even catch it and you can justsee Mark Healey he wanted itjust could not and I think at a certainpoint he was like okay I have a chanceto get out of this unscathed right andI'm gonna pull the pull the you know theemergency brake right now look at thisVision oh my gosh that's a monsteroh that was like almost if he would havekept going it would have looked likeBrock goofy foot yeah potentially thatone took out the bay yeah you knowcorner to corner at Waimea and that is aGiant Wavesee our next Heat getting somecocoa some help out to the lineup andpreparing for their second attemptthat'll be heat three that's on DeckHeat number twoof round two right now is the heat thatwe're watching live and look at all ofit looks like a giant unsavory hot tublook at the lines on the horizon andmore swells hitting the peak here atWaimeaChad look at the water Patrol oh they'reon the Move starting to gun it yeah theyrecognize where they're at as well andlook on out to the Horizon this droneview shows you the mountains of waterthat are approaching the lineup rightnow oh dropping into this one I thinkthat's Mark Healey againoh going for it swallowed oh my goshwhat a chargeran incredible free diver Rocky and Ithink he's freediving right now as wespeak it's expensive right now not sofree he's paying some pricebut yeah he is uh got back to thesurface sohe's one of those guys that yeah he candive deep 80 feet with on one breathmaybe plus I'm not gonna you knowshortchange him at all but he goes superdeep and he has to use all of it rightthere and what about the situation he'sin right now taking the rest on the headoh here we go look at this the waterPatrol better hurry guys there we gothey got itso impressive another big way ofapproaching here our safety teamHawaiian water Patrol I can't talk aboutit enough just so impressive on howquick the pickups are right now in thesehazardous giant conditions yeah and thecommunication too because we've got likesix or seven rescue skis out theretrying to uh you know triage and see whoneeds what when and where right you knowit's it's the big area but it gets smallwhen you put more skis in the water andyou know the fear and the uhresult of collision is real so theseguys got to be ultra aware that thenon-verbal communication as well justknowing what to do and knowing eachother so well is a big part of itreplay time oh boy here's Mark Healy ona bomb he was gonna do this on the wavebefore it gets a second chance and makesit all worth it huge drop that is goingto get some attention from our judges uhthat is that'sthat's what it's all about you knowexecuting uh those steep drops on giantwaves KK on the paddle out Kayla Kenleythere she goes with her body harnessleash thattechnique to protect the

we'll see where that leaves himwhen this is all said and done for Heatnumber two still got three moreaction-packed Heats to gobut we saw some you know big numbersperfect scores getting thrown down Imean when you look at the criteria ofwhat the Eddie is all about I feel thatthat needs to go there yeah and we'veseen the scores on the board already sokind of comparing those waves to MarkHealey's wave just now it is right onpar in parallelhappy to be parallel on the beach rightnow with his board laying therelet's check out this replay let's startfirst heretile tile shipment yeah he survivedsurvives the explosion kind of rode highon that one escaped it a little bitgave a little uhShaka to water Patrol as he rolled byand then was trying to negotiate thisinside section possibly for

ofreflection of appreciation and you justwonder what's going through eachindividual's head at the at the momentyeah but I feel like a lot of it is justyou know that admiration of what whatjust

two wahine inthis heat and we're going to look atsome action that we're going to catch upon that happened during our break Isaiahyeah look at the size of these waves itseems like the waves took a break for afew minutes but it's right back onyeahfrom Big Islandand I mean yeah during the break I wasjust I meanI hear all the eruption of the Applauseand just the excitement of it the energyto have those waves like closing out Isaw it Zeke took a heavy Wipeout yeahgot right right back out there caughtanother good one but Mark healy's waveman the way that wave exploded behindhim and he disappeared and then he cameout and uh what that how's that insidesection that took him out that wasincredible that left that was comingfrom the Haleiwa side I don't know ifI've ever seen I can't remember the lasttime I've seen that inside sectionlooking that huge and daunting it almostlooked as big as the peak was exactlyyeah that was kind of freaky of like youknow how far in he's riding and thenwhen that wave connects over from thatside it is not anywhere near the mainPeak but it was as tall as some of thebiggest waves out there that wasimpressiveso boy it's been an exciting day we'veseen so many good waves I really wasn'tup it has been like you know like ashocker right like every heat has beenaction which is I know that's reallyimportant because it this competitionthe way the format works if you do havea heat that seems to be you know moreconsistent than another then it doesn'tseem like it's as Fair of a shot or thatthe ocean is choosing its favorite heatexactly but today it doesn't seem thatway it seems like today like every heathas these setsum through Closeouts today she's notdiscriminating right equal opportunityfor all and there has been like you saidconsistent conditions there maybe was acouple of minutes here and there'sNathan Fletcher doing uh some PR workdown on the beach saying how's it to thesurf fans that are all so excited andKyle Shipman right there one of our verygood born and raised North ShoreBrothers talking to Nathan for a momentbut what an opportunity for all of thesebig Wave Riders we have two wahines inthis heat Justine DuPont from FranceKayla Kennelly from Kauai they're thetwo representing our joaquinas Surfersout here we have at least one in everyHeat this heat three we have two of themwe've got theveteranShane Dorian from the Big Island outthere with kahel heart another similaraged generation uh with brother Shane sokahea Hart getting in as an alternatefor Kelly Slater we saw kealijust on a wave a moment agoand the charging goofy foot BrazilianLucas chianka along with the verytalented and entertaining and creativeMason hope and rounding out this heatnumber three another veteran Peter Meland that looks like Mason whole possiblyin the red jersey oh look at thatwaterfall online he's trying to ridethrough it but unfortunately it throwshim off balance he's unable right out ofthat oneanother set on the outside we have arider upthat's keola in the blueChannelgetting a wave here in round two Heatnumber three of the Eddie big waveInvitationalout and look out the back Isaiah you seesome largesets approachingon our screen you can see it the littleContours and difference in the color ofthe water to indicate the size the swellit's hard to tell how big though fromhere and nothing like being on the beachbut for those of you who wanted to stayaway from all of the traffic ornot here in Hawaii it couldn't be hereon the beach we appreciate you guystuning in on screenevery time you look I was like ohthere's another set rightone of the most consistent big waveswells I believe that we've seen as faras a number of waves per each heat hasbeen and as you said earlier therehasn't really been uh off heat or a heatwith it extended lulls it's been fairlyconsistent for everybody across theboard our uh Professor engineer Justinstilpa wasn't here explaining to usit has to do with the fact that thestorm is close to us okay and so thewave period is uh it's a little closerbut it's also perfect offshore I mean hesaid it also contributes to a little bitof shiftiness to the peak oh my goodnessoh and somebody in OrangeLucas chianka justsending through himself sent it over theledgewe just got a glimpse of him from thatlive angle looking from kind of you knowthe the back of the wave or the the backdoor kind of lookingtowards the right-hander but he wasthere and then he wasn't there but youcan only imagine what he went throughbecause he looked like he was in a veryhard and precarious position rightfrom that angle if he ended up gettinginto it or if it blew him off the backbut he's got the ski assist soapparently he definitely didget that one on the headoh he's the one of red this was MasonJosue oh actually I think that might beJustine Dupont she's in the pink oh myGod so that was a great way amazing anduh back to back our wahine SurfersJustine and kealaable to hang on and thread the needleright there walk the tightrope as we seechianka I think he actually went andprobably went over you so I was boredfor a glimpse right there if there'sanother angle we could look at that waveof Lucas and just admire the commitmentthe charging[Music]because yeah I mean he had to becommitted that was crazythanks for correcting Justine Dupont didyou see that massive wave that shecaught at Cortez Bank last week oh mygosh I like how do you evenget the you know get your head in thatzone to go on a wave like that and forour our viewers who aren't aware umCortez bank is this wave that's likeover 100 miles off of San Diego it'sit's not even a land mass it's a reefthat's just in the middle of the oceanright and uh very rare and hard to getbecause mainly because of the windconditions have to be just right soanyway but Justine Dupont actually fromthat session her wave was the best oneat least from my opinion of thediscussion from what the footage I'veseen so farmassive wave so uh Justine on her lastwave I apologize the color mix up butthat was definitely just seen chargingamazing waves here at Waimea Bay thereyou see the lineup of jerseysour Surfers are wearing so we're prettymuch running you know with eight Surferswhere are all the colors of the rainbowrepresented right and everything inbetween uh if you think of new colorslet us know but we're trying to pick thebest colors that have the mostdistinction and uh identificationability because our red and our pink andour orange have sometimes been a littleuh cross-colored or uh you knowcross-pollinated when we're calling theshots on the screen here and thenum you know different lighting and andbrightness and and uh Darkness on thethe screen has made it a little therethere you see him right in a row likewow you know if they're on a wave RidingIn Motion it's a little tricky but uh wewant to uh thank you all for tuning inand bearing with us on on that littleside of things but it's been quite theentertaining day we're in the afternoonstretch here Heat number three 50-minuteHeats for this second round and we'veseen kale imamala get a couple get a onereally good wave in the beginningthen it was our wahine going back toback Justine and keala and looks likepossibly another opportunity out theback Isaiah yeah more lines off the backthank goodness the jet skis are there tohelp because there's you know on anormal day when you when you wouldn'thave the jet ski assist getting throughall that white water especially on thosecloseout sets would be you know verydifficultto the Horizon if there's anythingthat's going to be ridden here in thisset yeah I don't know but I see a lot ofactivity just on the outside so we'llsee if our Surfers start to move inposition a couple of surfers paddlingfor this one one of them gets itdrone is honing in onlooks like our Surfer in red Mason holdwith the switch stance little one footWonder right there we've seen a lot ofswitch stands today yeah yeah we saw KaiLenny hi Lenny uh Mason do it anothertime right I thinkJake Makiawhich is you know something that wasreally big actually during Eddie IKyle's time yeah in the 70s 60swould always be front side yeah I callit by Statue they're able to go eitherway which is really cool and they'llalways be front side you're right masonhall with the grinand the smilealways a character that guy is just theEntertainer has some of the best uhclips of him surfing on his on his onhis site on YouTube yeahum also just came up with adocumentary film called through thedoggy door so he's very active stayingbusy and here he is on this one yeahbeautifulnegotiation of that wave kind of playingwith it a little bit then of coursedoing the switch dance and gets the rugpulled out for Monday a little bityeah so honoring Eddie ikaw and hismemory and his legacy and all theamazing accomplishmentswhen when Eddie was uh surfing the NorthShore when he first started he was 16years old and talked about by the timehe was he was 20 he became the firstlifeguard on the North Shore and thenfor the next 10 years he just reallyhoned in his skills on surfing the NorthShore and his big goal was to to win theDuke Invitational which was the onereally premier professional surfingcompetition on the North Shorehe would usually make the finals eachyear final final but would get secondplace or third place uh it wasn't until1977 when he was 30 years old why heended up winning that event at SunsetBeach and it was kind of a crowningmovement moment a chronic achievement inhis life interestingly his youngerbrother Clyde I call who by the way wonthis event at 1986 right won the DukeInvitational 1973 before 84 Eddie soaccomplished Surfers you know even inthis event today we've seen generationswith Mason ho his dad is in this eventum we've we've seen a lot of a lot offamily Legacy in this eventum and so kind of cool that goes backeven to Eddie's story is hisrelationship with his brother andsurfing these events and super cool tobe a part of that tradition and thatwe're here still on the North Shorecelebratingso much talent and so much Legacy hereat Windmill yeah all these years laterwe're talking you knowfrom the timeline you just describedcompeting at the Duke you know at SunsetBeach you know we're talking uhdecades upon decadesand the fact that it is still so muchalive and well almost like he's stillhere and that type of respect and thattype of feeling that we're doing thisall these years later and uh the Manathe vibe the power the the being is suchis still so strongyeah a lot of that is because not onlywas he a great Surfer and a lifeguardthat saved many people's lives but alsohis commitment to his community andsacrificing literally his life to savethe crew on the Hokulea voyaging canoeit was in 1978 it was on a voyage toTahitithe canoe double canoe which was acouple it's a it's a it's a modern dayversion of a traditional sailing vesselthat Hawaiians and Polynesians sailed onfor thousands of years before1975-76 they went on their maiden voyageto Tahiti the purpose of the voyage wasto restore the the Mana and the prideand the knowledge that these Hawaiianswere great Navigators from ancient timesand so Eddie after he wins theInvitational signs up for this thesevoyagesand goes on the second voyage to Tahitiwhere the canoe encounters some troubledwaters right takes on some watereventually the canoe capsizes he has asurfboard with him on the canoe tries topaddle for safety but the nearest Islandwas more than 40 miles away wowhe's never seen again but thatcommitment to his community commitmentto his culture commitment to the peoplethat were on that canoefortunately there was an airplane thatflew over right an inner Island planeand saw the canoe and back thenum here we are supposed to celebratingbut you know the thewherewithal to to save his to risk hislife to save his canoe mates and hisfellow peoplesum just shows the kind of person and thecommitment that he had and so that'sanotheryou know layer to his legacy and thereasons why we celebrate him eventhrough this event yeah in the spirit ofthat uh camaraderie the spirit of thatselflessnessis amazingwhat transcends the competition itselfand the surfing in the big waves isEddie's Legacy and the way that you knowhe cared and uh his actions spokevolumes of how much he cared for otherpeople right A lot of times peoplethere's you know Erica and Duke of veryfamous people in Hawaiilived for you know to a very rape agelike he died in 1968 he was in his 70sYeah Eddie Aikau passed away at least 31years old apparently this is the 55thanniversary today of Duke passing rightuh so on point right there he you knowhad a uh fairly long and uh fruitfullife and Eddie unfortunately you knowcut shorter than we all would have likedbut it feels somewhat faded and anddestined yes when you even think aboutthe crew of the Hokuleaended up being saved if he would havestayed he could have also been saved butyou couldn't explain that to a guy likeEddie in that situation of no I'm gonnago and I'm gonna find help and I'm gonnado what I can and what I know how to doto give us our best shot of survival andthat was in the time of that momentthat's what he was feeling and he wentoff and like you said was never seenagainand encapsulate that Spirit that's wherethat slogan Eddie would go and that'swhat we talk about and maybe weperpetuate that here at this event andthese Surfers are willing to take thatsame risk in that charge to go when thewaves are massive in this uh event andsoum also trying to emulate I Supply ourour you know athletes are trying toemulate that Warrior spirit that Eddiebrought to uh to us in the surfingCommunity here we go look at that hugeLake Drive gosh two big late drops onedoes not surviveand that is Lucas chianka in the orangeputting it down wow that was acourageous attempt does a backflip incelebration very appropriate our Surferwho was in the front I believethat could have been red Mason hoe thatwas such a heavy wave it was so steep itwas so steep yep and for him for the twoof them right there together and manthat was a great way from Lucas jonkeror Surfer from Brazilthere's Lucas paddling back outlove the energy the back flip just againthat monari feel and especially catchinga wave of that manic magnitude and theenergy and the power that you're feelingas you're riding that wave yeah theexhilaration of the drop right there itlooks like he's a goner and I believethat is Mason Hall justfree falling out of the sky right nextto Lucas chianka and Lucas unfazed bythe free-falling Mason hoe just does agreat job making it through thatend section there we go Lucas and thenMason oh my gosh we'll hope Mason's okayhereallyfell hard right there he is paddlingnext toLucas and looks to bedoing pretty well back on his board atleast moving and paddling here we goanother big set oh my goodness off theback[Music]all rightall rightall right those boards are so big everytime you see a surfer try to you knowpump it and turn it it is like you knowyou're riding on ahugeloss that is like you know you're alumberjack all of a sudden trying tocarve this thing down the Chute andKelly he kicks out before he hits theshore break we've seen a couple ofsurfers attempting for thatOutside Inside connectionslike Shadow from Kona yep that wave wasbarreling right behind him as he wastaking offincredible waveour competitors dealing with thatmountainous whitewashersthis must be the tide and the swell allthe waves are starting to kind of closeon that inside section where you have tomake a decision am I going to keepriding and make it a long paddle backoutor am I going to kick out here and uhkind of quit while I'm ahead right and Ithink they also saw in that last Heatwhen Mark Healey straightened out whathow that worked out for him so maybethey're learning from that example yeahthat connecting swell coming from theHaleiwa side of the Bay is just rightnow being a little bit of a a nuisanceand uh stopping our Surfers from beingable to continue to the inside as wewatch keali imamala on a nice wavesurvived that white water and him tookind of looking down the line and thensees this section thought about thecutback a little bit sees the sectioncoming up ahead and says I'm gonna stophere although kicking out right therewas also kind of precariously the wavesright behind the bigger ones hopefullyhe made it over those but we have liveaction so much foam and whitewashingthat channelbarreling sets on the outsidesee if there'sanother Surfer out there in the lineupand get these next onesso ever ever since that incident 1978umrelief you know that it was kind of apivotal moment because it was a matterof like do we continue doing this Voyageor not hokuleo was basically swamped anduh that was another thing that theydecided just like we're seeing heretoday is just to send it they decided togo for it continue the voyaging and whenthey did it this time Eddie's spirit issort of a part of the Polynesianvoyaging society's Mission and purposeand voyages today they implemented a lotof changes from so now you know you haveto have an escort vote with you they'veimplemented a lot of safety precautionsand in many ways in the name of Eddie Icall and for his sacrifice to make surethat it wasn't in vain and um and I knowwhat Thompson who's the captain ofHokulea one of the captains he explainedreally nicely in a actually this reallycool documentary uh ESPN did a 30 for 30series yes and if you haven't seen itcheck that out I think it's on Disneyplus but in that filmumexplains like Eddie had to to go existthe idea of happy birthday which is avessel that carried the culture thepride of the culture during a veryimportant time in Hawaii's history knownas the Hawaiian Renaissance whenHawaiian culture and language and it wason the rise again so it was like kind ofessential that the canoe survivedbecause it was carrying with it thespirit and the culture of Hawaii youknow symbolically and so I know Thompsonexplains in this in this film he saysyou know I think the thought of nothaving that was too much to bear forEddie and here we have Kali mamala'swave replayedyeah surviving that reallythrustingrash of the bottom of the wave and Iheard you mention earlier as we watchedshano also big wave Legendand one more time here for our Surfer inyellow that is heart I heard youmentioned the uniqueness of the wave andsome of these big waves where they don'tcrash and reverberate upwards right itis outwards yeah laterally in front andthat just really creates Havoc for anysurfer trying to maintain balanceand getting a blast from behind andbeing able to hold on is really trickyand that's what adds to the excitementyou know usually we're watching eventsat pipeline for example we say that thewow factors when they're in the barreland it does you can't tell if they'recoming right or not even though wehaven't seen many barrels or any barrelsyet today uh still that being coveredcompletely by that explosion of a40-foot wave whitewashing over you yeahand then coming out afterwards I thinkMark Healey definitely brought that inthat close out and said he had in thatlast Heat so adding to the excitementthat explosion disappearing actdisappearing actyeah it is uh you know surfing hasseveral types of magic tricks as wewatch okay Olivia mamala live actionnicely negotiated drop there it is alittle disappearing act right there sopipeline you got the disappearing act inthe barrel the reappearing kind ofAbracadabra style here at Waimea theWaimea magic trick is getting explodedat the bottom of the wave and then beingable to re-emerge and reappearand reallypull a big rabbit out of a big hatlooking out to the Horizon lookingpossiblywith more action headed our way here inHeat number three of round two 50-minuteHeats for these eight Surfers to catchup to four waves there's a four wave Maxwhen you have eight Surfers in the waterbeing able toshare the lineup equally or as equallyas possibleand once you catch four waves in yourparticular Heatuh you are to move to the side or comein and or your you know your fifth waveand Beyond will not be scored obviouslybut that four wave Max implementedas we watch Kelly mamala one of his fourwavesthat's that last one we just watchedthat section that movement blows rightover it disappear and comes right backout[Music]we're gonna start you know getting intoour maneuver commentating when Kaylee isout there and uh raising a fist inVictory and appreciation kind of glidedover that section bottom turned andhopped and caught some air off thebottom to make it around that soincorporating a little bit of uhassistance from one of those chops atthe bottom going fins free for a secondand gaining speed in the processcool too about surface especially whenwe're talking about Eddie Aikau forexample he was surfing became thevehicle for him to express his culturehe was a lot like his mom in the sensethat his mom they said was was not itwas very soft-spoken person and peoplewould know Eddie and even though there'sso muchattention on him in this event when hein his real life he didn't want anyattention I was very humble guyvery good and uh said that he when hewould rescue or save somebody from thebeach you knowpeople would come up and want to thankhim and you knowbuy him something or you just give himthe simple Shaka man of few words andum so so but surfing was a vehicle forhim to express himself as a nativeHawaiian because surfing has its rootshere in Hawaii the tradition of what wecalland it's pretty impressive to uh but inmany ways too I'd say some of the mostfamous Hawaiian people people likeducanumoku and Eddie I callwe're surfers right and they were ableto establish and identify with theirculture through surfing during a timeperiod when a lot of Hawaiian culturalthings weren't really celebrated and weespecially saw that in dukaku's Era butwith with Eddie I call he represents histime period in 1960s and 1970sRebirth of identity and having pride inbeing Hawaiian because in Generationsprevious there wasn't as much maybethere was a lot of you know frowning onHawaiian thingsbut it's really cool that Eddie's aproduct of that time period and becomesa great Ambassador for the culture ofSurfing and the culture of Hawaii we'regonna take a short break where Heatnumber three we'll be right back after aword from our sponsors stay right herewe

you know they're beingyou know run all Pistons firing you knowredlining every set that comes in somaybe some tinkering maybe some uhrecalibrating on the jet ski but luckything we've got a lot of Good Help inthe way of pouring water Patrol and ourNorth Shore lifeguards down therehandling the business we appreciate youguys very muchwe've got two guys paddling for this onenice deep wave they're close to eachother they are really close[Applause]yeah we got some real camaraderie hereyeahI think that's Shane Dorianout in front and uh behind it might havebeen Peter Mel in the black looked likea darker colored Jersey we'll get thatconfirmation though ID when we can butdefinitely look like shano was in thepurple coming towards us riding thatwave a little longer he was out in frontand uhpossibly Peter Mill in the black thedeeper Surfer kind of caught up to himand thenyou know those two guys they've been atthis for a while uh Peter probably alittle longer than Shane uh in the formof experience and and age level but uhthe uh appreciation and admiration equalamong both of those Surfers you knowSaint Doran has been an invitee to thiseventum since the early since the 90s so yeahhe's been uh he's a Mainstay in thesurfing world with big wave surfing yesone of those that pioneered you knowsurfing and Jaws on Maui and also helpwith the development of the safety vestthat they're using yeah and you knowtalking earlier about the HawaiianRenaissance that Eddie was a part of andthat time frame of the 60s and 70s whenwe come to the early 2000s from the late90s to the early 2000s the attentionkind of shifted into the towing in bigwave Arena and the you know impressivethings you could do when you involve ajet ski and catching waves and theManeuvers because you didn't have topaddle Shane Dorianwas part of that crewthe Renaissance crew if you will goingback to paddle in and the original formof wave catchingwow look how close they are to eachother that is Peter melon the blackhe isback in the blackcomesthe camaraderie therewow it's like the Titanic yeahDon't Let Gomight have been our first Embrace on awave during an Eddy I don't know if thatwas like Hey call of my sorry brotherhey let's do this together but we're onit togetherGreat Waveso in that situation Peter Mill mightget the nod with a little bit higherscore being the deeper Surfer but onceagain no no penalty no interferenceand the non-priority situation just auhkind of gentleman gentlewoman's prioritysituation out there who you know you cankind of see you know who's in the betterspot and give way to those Surfers thatare in the spot and for yourself ifyou're not you achieve to be in thatbetter spot on the next set so it's areal[Music]camaraderie and not so much a hardcorecompetition even though 39 000 for thewinner excuse me ten thousand dollarsfor the winner does sound likea great payday and of course they'd loveto have each Surfer would have the loveto have their nameetched onto the Eddie Aikau big waveInvitational trophynow we're seeing some more sets off thebackto the horizonwe're talking about the Hawaiian waterPatrolis a lifeguard that tradition oflifeguarding and rescuing is has deeproots in Hawaii that goes even back totowas hired by the Red Cross to travelaround the United States and to teachpeople how to save people check out thiswave off the back a bomb oh my goodnessthere was some unfortunate soul on thatwave it was a colossal wall of waterUncle Clyde getting uh some work done onthe beach right there handling thedirecting you know part of it wants tobe out there but also there is uh youknow the responsibility of making sureeverything is going smoothly on thebeach and up in the scaffolding but wowa huge wave and a crazy Wipeout for oneof our Surfers looks like everybody'sokay but yeah I saw a small Speck and abig splash which isa pause you could see somebody catchingit and then there wasn't anything andthen splashed right so that free fall uhlasted for a little while oh man remindsme a little bit of that we saw a ZekeLao earlierum and there was another server or SouthAfrican Surfer also had another one ofthose grand Twiggy Banker soman that definitely is dramatic we hopethat Surfer is okay and try and ID thatfor you in a moment you know most timesin the best case scenario of that badsituationyou are able to get some penetrationinto the wave and out the backas we see another ride here from one ofour goofy foot backside Surfers thatlooks to be orange Lucas[Music]who had an amazing ride earlier in thisheat now just adding some numbers to hisscore working that forward back andforthoh doing a turn oh wow carving it that'sa big board to be carving approachingthe inside shore break is he gonna makeit he's gonna do it all over oh my goshand then just goes back on his heels butI think that might be the first time inEddie commentary we narrated Themaneuver floateron the shore going for it love this guysdefinitely got a lot of youthful energythat he brings to big wave surfing himand Kai Lenny have done amazing thingstogethersurfing there in Portugal with massivewaves and still you know do 360 errorson the kick outs and so I love the theenergy and the playfulness of it verymuch yeah he's been at this big wavegame for a long time and worked reallyhard to be one of the you knowrecognizable names and always there uhwhether it was WaimeaNazareth Todo Santos all the big namebreaks Mavericks Lucas has been thereand he's been there for a long time andhe's still doing itplus these guys surfs really good onsmall waves too on shorter boards yeahit's cool to seeum oh well hopefully he's all right hereI see him getting some assistance up thebeach left the board forhis caddy to manage for him and justgetting onto The High Ground thecheckout possibly a knee injury possiblyan anklehe was hobbling up the beach you knowgetting some help hopping on that onefoothere is the Wipeout oh my gosh I thinkthat might have been chaolo Kennellyyeah in the blue just absolutely puttingit on the linehuge huge wave andthe amount of guts and commitment to beable to hurl yourself over a ledge likethat isalmost difficult to understand oh mygoodness she is so Fearless we've seenher in massive waves uh in Tahiti and inPipeline and now at Waimea just sendingit this was the last replay of Lucaschumble his leg seems okay at thatmomentI don't know if it was uh we'll we'lltry and see if it was the floater ormaybe when he was on the inside hisboard chopped him at the at the legs butwe'll see what happens hereyeah he goes uphits the the whitewash right there andpossibly something underneath waterhappened right there he was rollingfairly close to his board andcould have uhhad contact with his board underwaterwhich you know another scary part ofSurfing waves like this is the equipmentthat you have to ride it's not a little6-0 twig you know it is a huge heavy logwith a lot of sharp edgesand when you're getting rolled in a bigwhite water like that the amount offorce that can be from your body andfrom your board can be very verydangerouswell good news is he's he's there andhe's uh you know talking into the to oursafety crew andgetting the attention that he needshopefully it's just something minora lot of folks stillchecking out the action live on thebeach right there a very unique view tobe basically ground level you knowGround Zero for seeing the mass heightof these waves and also feeling thatThunder of the crashing shore break andthe big waves on the outside and thenyou have kind of the second tierSpectators that are gathered along thecliffs and the Bluffsoh and some of the very lucky Spectatorsthat are in those houses that frontWaimea point right there there's JustineDupont on that wave it looked like theuh have crossed with another competitoryeah Justine one of our two wahinecompetitors in this heat we saw kealaKennelly with the absolute charging thatlooked heavier than any white boat we'veseen today that chaos just sending itas the last one we are just in Dupontand another Rider there hopefully therewasn'tyou know interference on that one butthey got kind of close to each otheryeah that might have beenum it might have been keola joining herit was a goofy foot Surferand Lucas and keala are the only twogoofy foots in this heat so Lucas is onthe beach uh tending to uh possible leginjury or mishap there so we hope thebest for Lucas and I think that waskeala that was mixing it up and sharinga wave with Justinebig props to our female competitors allsix of them showing up strong all ofthem catching waves and Big Surf andcharging it and as I was saying earlieruh Rocky that it'sit's it's appropriate because inHawaiian culture in ancients Hawaiiantimes a lot of stories of Hawaiian womensurfing and most notably there's onenamed keleaso kelea for short was from Maui and shewas one of the best Surfers of Hawaiiand so it's hundreds of years ago in ouruh the annals of Hawaiian history andshe eventually moves over to Oahu whereshe becomes a a popular figure inWaikiki we're pretty well known yeahyeah and where she ends up surfing anduh awesome waves here on Oahu but fromMaui powerful Chief and noted to beingyou know she marries a guy namedkalamuku who's a chief in Waikiki andthe two of them become like the surfingpowered couple power couple yeah it's agood good description they said when thewaves were huge she would go out to theouter breaks in Waikiki and ride thewaves all the way across the baysomething that Duke hanumoku was laternoted for doing on those rare occasionsto catch one from castles way all theway outside connects connecting it andso kelea was known as one of these greatwomen Surfers and so it's so awesome tosee in this event uh it's in this heatwe see Justine Dupont and Kayla Kennellycharging these massive waves here atWaimea Bay and uh so awesome awesome tobe revisiting history and and Legacy andand talking aboutEddie Aikau and the kind of Legacy hehad and admonition to all of us to tocarry on those kinds of values that werepassed on for Marco Puna like theseindividuals like Eddie I callwell we've gotHeat number threeactive right now some of heat numberfour might have made their way into thewater you see quite a few jerseys thatare in the lineup or around the lineuparea currently and that would be uh thatwould be the reason for that eightSurfers in each Heatin this second round we're pushing thetime up to 50 minutes per heat as youlook up look at a great drone shot fromthe Waimea Point side looking Westtowardsthe Waianae mountain range in thebackground and the rest of the NorthShore that's down towardsChantry flatio Kea all the way down toHaleiwa andshimmeringsunlight on the waterlooking quite tranquil right now onscreen but it is so crazy how it turnsto chaos and speaking of ControlledChaos our Spectators on the beach lookslike they're all behaving themselvesenjoying yeah bro you are doing what youdo and uh great to see

inspiring asyou said earlier inspiring is uh youknowa light way to put it it's beyondinspiration yeah well Billy Kemper beingan inspiring individual you can checkout the doc series Billy simply

boxforeign[Music][Music]what if an injured person or theirfamily doesn't have money to pay alawyer after someone is seriouslyinjured they're often worried aboutmedical bills rent just putting food onthe table the last thing that they canafford is to pay money to a lawyer andthat's why at Levitt Yumani and soldnerwe never ask for money from injuredpeople everything is on a contingencyfee basis that means that it costsnothing to hire us and we only get paidif we recover for our clientback on the beach at Waimea Bay the siteof the Eddie big wave Invitational inmemory of ADI kaipo along with RockyCannon and pretty casual stroll down thebeach right now for Paige alms who'sgoing to be coming up in the last Heatof the day yeah heat five on the beachright there getting set tosurf their second round second heat ofthe day yep and I gotta imagine you knowit just takes so much out of youit's only 45 minutes it's only 50minutes but the adrenaline that'spumpingthe wipeouts you know the good ridesyou know even a good ride you have ahorrendous Wipeout at the end of so itis just taxing on the body I'm suregosh it's surfing right so the paddle isa pull-up the pop-up to push-up yeah andyou got to hold your breath also yeahyou know and think about paddling forall your might is like sprinting Yesexcept you're laying on your lungsinstead of upright yeah so gravity's notin your favor gravity's not in yourfavor and you know air is a commodity ohmy gosh and sometimes a luxury preciousyesyou'll realize Rocky you know I mean usas Surfers but just to describe to theaudience how precious air is when it'staken away from youand you're not in control of when you'regoing to have it again oh my gosh panicattackbut the Surfers are the most highlyconditioned athletes in my opinion byfar any other sport that you want tobring to the table uh and compareI would have to say the amount ofstrength and endurance the amount ofmental fear you have to overcome inthese kind of big wave situationsand holding your breath and being ableto swim I mean you know I love watchingother sports but you know sorry Mr NFLyou're gonna die today if you go outtherehey LeBron yeah you stay up on the beachover here okay bro yeah that's right andyou know surfing being more more thanjust a sport a celebration or cultureabsolutely and it's a and it's in somany ways so fulfilling and healing forpeople's lives and so that's why we'recelebrating surfing the sport of Surfingwe're celebrating the active surfingwe're celebrating the life times andLegacy of someone like Eddie Aikau whowas able

secondtitle in the dying moments of the eventfrom Kelly Slater in 2009 and herdefending champJohn John Florence 2016 champ so we hada you knowa couple of years like you know from 99to 2002 had a good

take it to the beachending with a finale possibly a nicebottom turn right there maneuvering thatnine six plus board like uh he's atSunset Beach and then it says umI've done enough yeahwell because the short break this yearyou talked about the sand Rocky theBruce irons here you know 2000 uh 2004when Bruce pulled in on the show rightthere was a different sand situation itseemed like in the short break where theshore break was much hollower yeah rightnow the waves seem like they're rollingthrough yeah and it's kind of you knowChanges Day by Day obviously uh with thethe positioning of the sand so muchwater moving but it seems like for thisparticular day it's not forming upthat's with that same you knowferociousness and veracity as it wasduring that Bruce irons uh Victoryalthough we could see the sand movearound a little bit we haven't seen ashore break Connection in a couple ofHeats now but the ones we did see therewere a lot of double ups and triple upsand not really the gaping barrel uh thatwe sometimes mostly see at Waimea shorebreak but there's a nice big long dropfor our Surfer in red that was JamieMitchell nicely negotiated there and onthe outside Billy Kemperfree falls into one thatgets quite foamy and as you said kaipothat soupy sectionyou know almost looks like Mom's cornchowder right there with a couplepotatoes did pop over and uhnibletsright inside but Billy kicks out and uhsome live action beautiful Unwrittenwavewow and a spray big enough that it'sgoing to make a rainbow yeah wowthe iconic Peter and Paul Church that'sin so manyWaimea photos and videos

four fin a little more gripfaster without the drag of that trailerfin but let's look at Beauty campprogram yeah Billy with just a beautifulDrop I mean this wave had a sense ofkind of ease at the beginning and asmoothness to it but when he got to thebottom and the thing stood up it wasanything but those two adjectives it wasgnarly big and difficult and then hecomes outto the flats here and wants to leteverybody know he's feeling good andwe're happy for Billy as well I didn'trealize he grabbed his rail to be ableto turn the board back to the left toget going down the line in the shorebreakand gives it one more and then one moreand lays down and makes it back to thebeach safely well done Billy Kemper whata warrior impressive performance I won'tbe surprised if his name is

JDMitchell air dropping through here getsa little Bobble in the middle of thewave no problem lots of white watersurrounding him and that white watersweeps must his feet he's gonna say noproblem and then there's a problem uhJamie Mitchellgood job surviving that drop that wasnot easy his board became disconnectedfrom the wave yeah that was the the keypart most of the score is going to comefrom making the drop and getting to thebottom and getting a turn in uh afterthat just riding through just just alittle you know fractional element justa little sprinkle on there on your scoreright Rocky but it's really about thesize of the wave the commitment to thedrop in the line you take yeah you knowthe little uhextra frosting cherry on top with somerainbow sprinkles is what is happeningwhen you get past the treacherous pointof the drop and that crazy explosionthat'salmost accompanying every ride thatthese Surfers attemptand looks likesome assistance back to Shore byHawaiian water Patrol deep

surfing Rockywe're gonna find out who our champ iswe got a lot of stuff happening rightnow some of your favorite moments so farof todayuh I would have to say uhMark Healey's performance on two ofthose huge waves was outstanding uh Idid like the early wave in the morningof Landon McNamara yep that was a bombum and uhEzekiel some awesome moments as wellhighlighting uh we saw an outstandingperformance by Billy Kemper coming offan injured Billy Kemper right John JohnFlorence has been sneaky quiet making itlook easy but it has been Gathering bigscores and he's our defending champ canJohn John do it again we're going tofind out after this final heat of theday and let's uh talk about this heatright now first we got some sets comingin before we can do a heat introductionso we'll see if anyone catches a waveand we'll then we'll get to uh theSurfers eight Surfers out in the waterand these are walls mountains of waterright now likely we're gonna have atakereveryone looking at that one and thatone just sucks off of The Reef youmentioned the wind earlier and how it'sgetting a little stronger and we noticethe ehukai the Ocean Spray off the topof the wave reaching a little higher andmore pronounced than early this morningso providing yet another obstacle if youwill for dropping in on these huge wavesuh besides the fact that they're about50 feet tall wave and current coming upthat face makes it extra tricky anddifficult yeah here we go look at thiswe'll see againif we have any takers there's the packout there eight Surfers out in the waterwho wants this oneand again just trying to defy gravitybut just the physics of paddling intothat wave look too difficult yeah noteven Albert Einstein could complete thatone and he's like what I don't care whatthe heck is going on here this is notright the math just doesn't add upinertia volume speed pause it all add upso that I can paddle into this MovingWall of ocean and not just because tocatch a wave you have to first of all wetalk about physics you have to match thespeed of the wave in the first place tocatch the wave and bigger waves thebigger the wave is faster right correctso the the faster you have to paddle tocatch a bigger wave yeah and thenthere's an inertia that you have tocarry to get down the face of the waveI got my chalkboard right here we'refiguring out all kinds of algebra yeahalgorithmsalgebraithms for sure getting busted outright everybody through connect that'srighthere we go here's a replay this happenedduring the break oh my goodness just uhcrazy late drop that was super well donethat was uh

we've seenthe waves actually grow in size againfor the conclusion I mean we're gonnahave an unprecedented stay tuned we'llbe back for day number two of the Eddieuh one day event guys and I don't wantto get anybody's hopes up but it is justan amazing drop right there for blackTyler Laurent wowsecond generation Big Wave Rider fromMaui and uhliking the feeling there he was claimingitcelebration time for Tyler Laurent thatwas a healthyhugevertical drop that he just negotiatedfrom here looked quite easy but folksthat wasa lot of technical skill to get downthat wave and a lot of bravado to evenpaddle yourself into that way yeah TylerRon 27 years old from Maui uh firstEddie that he's experiencing right nowwhoa and another drop thereRoss Clark Jonesstill doing it Ross Park Jones our 2001Eddie champ and he's still at it goshwhat a relic and a legend living legendjust incredible to see him still outhere and he's out there with Michael hoand when you start to uh you know thinkof the amount of years of experience thecombination of those two Surfers inparticular it is uh over a century yeahI mean it's Ross Clark's eighth Eddiethat he's surfing in you know he tookthat win but he also placed thirdyou know uh and in uh in the Eddie inthe past he's got hit fifth place he'sbeen consistent in his finishes here butof course the big win was in 2001 forrcj yeahand it looks like possibly a loose boardnow it might beI was gonna say had the old school jbgairbrush that board of the unmistakableMcCool rock man so we'll see uh seewhere he is more importantly than theboard we see the board making it all theway to Shore and uh hopefully Hawaiianwater Patrol is uhin the company of makua Rothman outthere so broken leash it appears formakua Rothmanand wow the board did not stopthat whole wave completed ride for theboard here we go out the back in BlackTyler Laurent that is uhmassive Eddy type wave that Tyler justnegotiated very nicely and the watershot looking in and

we're getting here from theDrone just sweeping over the lineupgiving us an idea of the positioning ofthe Surfers you can see that boil rightthere yepthat notorious boil Infamous and Michaelho right there yeah he's right on theboil that's the veteran right there 65years young oh here's our award and withthat iconic shot of ADI cow yep thatveryinternationally known famous red boardhe wascaptured writing for so many years outhere at Waimea we saw a rider rightthere was Ramon novaro in the red jerseyor Chilean chargeryeah Ramon Navarro I think you rememberI think in 20um2000 2009 Ramon rode that crazy wave andnearly closed out the bay here's thereplay of Navarroyeah and at one point in time you knowhewould have been possibly our first goofyChampion he was right there kind ofscratching at the tips of theleaderboard clawing his way to the thetopportion of yeahthat year and uh just couldn't quitepull it off yeah 2009 he got fifth but Imean he was right there he was at thetop of the leaderboard at one pointmakukai Rothman and Hawaiian waterPatrol battling their way back out intothe lineup how hard is that yeah that isjust a tough sledding like we saidearlier andtrying to read the ocean that is got somany differentchops and waves and you knowsidewash backwash huge white wash so alot of different angles and a lot ofdifferent looks that you have to beaware of when you're on board that jetski because that's a lot of washing butit's not clean inside there oh you knowit's not clean yeah maybe the dirtiestwash you'll ever get but you know andthen you factor in the you know thespectatorinfluence and awareness that you havethat you're on stage right basicallythere's nowhere to hide and you're nothiding especially if you fall off theski and you're underwater you're stillnot hiding everybody knows what happenedandto try to operate safely to prevent thatfor one it's you know uha loose jet ski a lot of times is is ahazard in itself so just staying onboard is very difficult staying on boardif I would drop like that also verydifficult I believe that was Ramon onceagain in the red yeah the goofy foot andthen out in front was uhpossibly page alms yeah so page arms onthe shoulder there and Ramon Navarrotaking a straightcrazy drop on the back end but againgetting engulfed by the White Water herein the final heat of the day this is thefinal Heatof round number two replay here yeahRamon just in that super deep positionyou see all the water kind of coming upthe side of his rail indicating howsteep that drop was and how close he wasto not making the drop and then once hegot to the bottom there was nowhere torun that wave was right on top of themmore lines here Rocky formulating sonthe hit reef atWaimea Anticipation by our competitorsand positioning you can see on theinside there and the yellow Jersey RossClark Jones the deepest Michael ho inthe orange Jersey right on the boilgetting ready to gofirst wave of the set looks like a steepit looks like a bigger second wave yeahyou know these first waves they'reeither the forerunners or they're theones with that really gnarly hairy dropthat we've been seeing andlooks like we've got Michael Hallpaddling for

all the way throughthe bumpy soup right here anda couple of chops could have taken himdown but he's got a solid stance littlecarve to the the backhand right thereand then switches Direction back to theleft looking for the barrel but insteadit likes to ride straight out and evensurvive that second explosion like rightthere that was impressive that was solidso are the solid lines coming throughhere time for it everyone to scratch itto position spins around there yellowgoes for him it has to spin around thatwas Ross Clark Jones put himself in adeep position right now we'll see whathappens to Ross Clark yeah the next waveeven biggerrcj the deepest the furthest in thiswave is Feathering Rocky it is huge Rossis not going to make this one no I don'tthink sooh oh that's the worstoh oh that's breaking really far out andRoss is rightaway nowhere to be seenhe's somewhere in that area in thatwhitewash that you couldn't see him withthe wave in the foreground but where hewas paddlingI don't think he was gonna make it overchose to pound for the first wave ofthat set couldn't get into it then everysurfer's nightmare yeah spin around andand you know what though every singer'snightmare scaled up yeah quite a fewnotches yeah but he's back on his boardalready Rocky I just saw himthat's what Champs are made out ofalready back on his board paddling backout Ross Clark Jones or 2001 Eddie champout therewhat a heroflying by you can see the boils in thelineup and the positioning of ourcompetitors outside of those boils rightnow Rocky yeah there's that one reallypronounced boil you can see going up alot of the big waves and that'ssometimes the you know the the indicatorpositioning point that the Surfers arestriving to be behind the boil look atthe animal Ross Clark Jones where he'ssitting so far inside now you know andhe just he's almost humbled daring whiteman as well he's like I'm still gonnasit here I'm still gonna do itRamon Navarro asking about time how muchmore time left in this heat the finalheat of the day sets again looming onthe horizonand emptying on to the Deep Reef here atWaimeayeah such a crazy pronounced shelf wherethe waves break and they have to comefrom water that's so deep and that's whythe wave just jacks up and gets so steepI mean itit does something that I think is youknow very unique especially along waveshere on the North Shore to where it'sjust so much water and hits that Reef sobut it's still a pretty deep wave rightso Rocky like what's it what's it feelwhat's it how deep is it like if you hitthe bottom at Waimea how deep on thewater are you I mean you're going atleast15 to 20 feet down and that's that'svery deep I mean you start to feel thepressure in your ears when you're thatfar down and I've never hit the reefhere at Waimea but I know Surfers whohave yeah and uh it's it's always like acome again you know did you say you justhit the reef oh my gosh but if you didhit the reef you also know it's a longway up to find the surface and air againif you feel like you're bouncing on thebottom at Waimea or touch the bottomyeahyou know you're in trouble uh veryvery scary position to be in and umsome more waves approaching it'sdefinitely not slowing down as we hitthis afternoon uh type of day uh time ofday and lots more surfingheading our way and we could see someonefrom this heatjump up to the

sand that's caught in betweenthe coral getting spit up in plumesbecause of how much water's moving andsweeping through the bay and like wesaid it's deep water so the energy ofthese waves actually

justin moments where there is good to bedone as the Eddie akau Foundation saysthat you'll be more prone and apt tomake sure you're part of that slogan aswell yeah I like itEddie Aikau umsaved so many lives it was such a greatexample for actually for young Hawaiiansas well as well asfor ocean goes everywhere Surferseverywhere and voyagers with the workthat he did with the hokule yes and thePolynesian voyaging Societyand really one of the instruments of theHawaiian Renaissance in the late 70sthat made native Hawaiians start to feelproud of their culture proud of theirlanguage proud of their practices andwhat the practices issurfing yepand then you know just the oceanknowledge you know how to how to conductyourself in and around the ocean in andaround your your fellow peers that arealso enjoying the oceanum and there's something to be said alsoof someone like Eddie who just you knowknows what current to use to paddle backout you know little things like that goa long way in the way you conductyourself in your particular lineup andnot only being one of the ocean but alsolike we've been talking about yourfellow Surfers and the etiquette and therest that goes with being and carryingthe responsibility as a surfer Yeah inour community right in the and theHawaiian kind of concept of ofhumbleness in that the ocean will humbleyou and for sure approaching the oceanand these guys right now every singleone of these Surfers men and womenthey're humble individuals but at thesame timespecial you know exceptional humanbeings to be able to to do what they doand ride these waves but at the sametime you talk to any of these big WaveRiders you'll find some of the mosthumble down-to-earth people becausethey've learned the lesson that yeah theocean is bigger than all of us right youknow and it's something to be respectedand celebrated and and to take care ofit yeah and you mentioned you know thethe guts and the and the commitment toride these waves but I think you knoweven more is like the guts andcommitment to come back from these crazywipeouts and survive the wipeouts whereyou know the the normal human being isnot peddling out there and then maybe alittle ex exceptional they would go outthere but then get drilled and be rightback on the beach going I want no moreof that yeah these guys and girls thesewomen and men competitorsjust keep going back out for more andthat's what's the exceptional thingabout them and to come back frominjuries you know we've seen Surfers outthere with Billy Kemper with the kneebrace we saw mccookai Rothman and thisheat he's

totake and and come coming back from thatis a a battle and a growing experiencein itself yeah and I'm sure the Surfersthat have paddled out here that wereslightly or majorly injuredaren't gonna have

       "'The Renaissance (UK:  rin-AY-sənss, US:   REN-ə-sahnss) is a period in history and a cultural movement marking the transition from the Middle Ages to modernity, covering the 15th and 16th centuries and characterized by an effort to revive and surpass the ideas and achievements of classical antiquity; it occurred after the crisis of the Late Middle Ages and was associated with great social change in most fields and disciplines, including art, architecture, politics, literature, exploration and science. In addition to the standard periodization, proponents of a \"long Renaissance\" may put its beginning in the 14th century and its end in the 17th century.The traditional view focuses more on the Renaissance\\'s early modern aspects and argues that it was a break from the past, but many historians today focus more on its medieval aspects and argue that it was an extension of the Middle Ages. The beginnings of the period—the early Renaissance of the 15th century and the Italian Proto-Renaissance from around 1250 or 1300—overlap considerably with the Late Middle Ages, conventionally dated to c.\\u20091350–1500, and the Middle Ages themselves were a long period filled with gradual changes, like the modern age; as a transitional period between both, the Renaissance has close similarities to both, especially the late and early sub-periods of either.\\nThe Renaissance\\'s intellectual basis was its version of humanism, derived from the concept of Roman humanitas and the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy, such as that of Protagoras, who said that \"man is the measure of all things\". Early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the revived knowledge of how to make concrete. Although the invention of metal movable type sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century, the changes of the Renaissance were not uniform across Europe: the first traces appear in Italy as early as the late 13th century, in particular with the writings of Dante and the paintings of Giotto.\\nAs a cultural movement, the Renaissance encompassed innovative flowering of Latin and vernacular literatures, beginning with the 14th-century resurgence of learning based on classical sources, which contemporaries credited to Petrarch; the development of linear perspective and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality in painting; and gradual but widespread educational reform. In politics, the Renaissance contributed to the development of the customs and conventions of diplomacy, and in science to an increased reliance on observation and inductive reasoning. Although the Renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual and social scientific pursuits, as well as the introduction of modern banking and the field of accounting, it is perhaps best known for its artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, who inspired the term \"Renaissance man\".The Renaissance began in Florence, one of the many states of Italy. Various theories have been proposed to account for its origins and characteristics, focusing on a variety of factors, including Florence\\'s social and civic peculiarities at the time: its political structure, the patronage of its dominant family, the Medici, and the migration of Greek scholars and their texts to Italy following the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks. Other major centers were Venice, Genoa, Milan, Rome during the Renaissance Papacy, and Naples. From Italy, the Renaissance spread throughout Europe and also to American, African and Asian territories ruled by the European colonial powers of the time or where Christian missionaries were active. \\nThe Renaissance has a long and complex historiography, and in line with general skepticism of discrete periodizations, there has been much debate among historians reacting to the 19th-century glorification of the \"Renaissance\" and individual cultural heroes as \"Renaissance men\", questioning the usefulness of Renaissance as a term and as a historical delineation. Some observers have questioned whether the Renaissance was a cultural \"advance\" from the Middle Ages, instead seeing it as a period of pessimism and nostalgia for classical antiquity, while social and economic historians, especially of the longue durée, have instead focused on the continuity between the two eras, which are linked, as Panofsky observed, \"by a thousand ties\".The term rinascita (\"rebirth\") first appeared in Giorgio Vasari\\'s Lives of the Artists (c. 1550), anglicized as the Renaissance in the 1830s. The word has also been extended to other historical and cultural movements, such as the Carolingian Renaissance (8th and 9th centuries), Ottonian Renaissance (10th and 11th century), and the Renaissance of the 12th century.\\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\nThe Renaissance was a cultural movement that profoundly affected European intellectual life in the early modern period. Beginning in Italy, and spreading to the rest of Europe by the 16th century, its influence was felt in art, architecture, philosophy, literature, music, science, technology, politics, religion, and other aspects of intellectual inquiry. Renaissance scholars employed the humanist method in study, and searched for realism and human emotion in art.Renaissance humanists such as Poggio Bracciolini sought out in Europe\\'s monastic libraries the Latin literary, historical, and oratorical texts of antiquity, while the fall of Constantinople (1453) generated a wave of émigré Greek scholars bringing precious manuscripts in ancient Greek, many of which had fallen into obscurity in the West. It was in their new focus on literary and historical texts that Renaissance scholars differed so markedly from the medieval scholars of the Renaissance of the 12th century, who had focused on studying Greek and Arabic works of natural sciences, philosophy, and mathematics, rather than on such cultural texts.\\nIn the revival of neoplatonism, Renaissance humanists did not reject Christianity; on the contrary, many of the Renaissance\\'s greatest works were devoted to it, and the Church patronized many works of Renaissance art. But a subtle shift took place in the way that intellectuals approached religion that was reflected in many other areas of cultural life. In addition, many Greek Christian works, including the Greek New Testament, were brought back from Byzantium to Western Europe and engaged Western scholars for the first time since late antiquity. This new engagement with Greek Christian works, and particularly the return to the original Greek of the New Testament promoted by humanists Lorenzo Valla and Erasmus, helped pave the way for the Reformation.Well after the first artistic return to classicism had been exemplified in the sculpture of Nicola Pisano, Florentine painters led by Masaccio strove to portray the human form realistically, developing techniques to render perspective and light more naturally. Political philosophers, most famously Niccolò Machiavelli, sought to describe political life as it really was, that is to understand it rationally. A critical contribution to Italian Renaissance humanism, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola wrote De hominis dignitate (Oration on the Dignity of Man, 1486), a series of theses on philosophy, natural thought, faith, and magic defended against any opponent on the grounds of reason. In addition to studying classical Latin and Greek, Renaissance authors also began increasingly to use vernacular languages; combined with the introduction of the printing press, this allowed many more people access to books, especially the Bible.In all, the Renaissance can be viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the secular and worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity and through novel approaches to thought. Hans Kohn describes it as an age where \"Men looked for new foundations\"; some like Erasmus and Thomas More envisioned new reformed spiritual foundations, others. in the words of Machiavelli, una lunga sperienza delle cose moderne ed una continua lezione delle antiche (a long experience with modern life and a continuous learning from antiquity).Some scholars, such as Rodney Stark, play down the Renaissance in favor of the earlier innovations of the Italian city-states in the High Middle Ages, which married responsive government, Christianity and the birth of capitalism. This analysis argues that, whereas the great European states (France and Spain) were absolute monarchies, and others were under direct Church control, the independent city-republics of Italy took over the principles of capitalism invented on monastic estates and set off a vast unprecedented Commercial Revolution that preceded and financed the Renaissance.Leon Poliakov offers a critical view in his seminal study of European racist thought: The Aryan Myth.  According to Poliakov, the use of ethnic origin myths are first used by Renaissance humanists \"in the service of a new born chauvinism\".\\n\\n\\n== Origins ==\\n\\nMany argue that the ideas characterizing the Renaissance had their origin in Florence at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries, in particular with the writings of Dante Alighieri (1265–1321) and Petrarch (1304–1374), as well as the paintings of Giotto di Bondone (1267–1337). Some writers date the Renaissance quite precisely; one proposed starting point is 1401, when the rival geniuses Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi competed for the contract to build the bronze doors for the Baptistery of the Florence Cathedral (Ghiberti then won). Others see more general competition between artists and polymaths such as Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Donatello, and Masaccio for artistic commissions as sparking the creativity of the Renaissance.\\nYet it remains much debated why the Renaissance began in Italy, and why it began when it did. Accordingly, several theories have been put forward to explain its origins. Peter Rietbergen posits that various influential Proto-Renaissance movements started from roughly 1300 onwards across many regions of Europe.\\n\\n\\n=== Latin and Greek phases of Renaissance humanism ===\\n\\nIn stark contrast to the High Middle Ages, when Latin scholars focused almost entirely on studying Greek and Arabic works of natural science, philosophy and mathematics, Renaissance scholars were most interested in recovering and studying Latin and Greek literary, historical, and oratorical texts. Broadly speaking, this began in the 14th century with a Latin phase, when Renaissance scholars such as Petrarch, Coluccio Salutati (1331–1406), Niccolò de\\' Niccoli (1364–1437), and Poggio Bracciolini (1380–1459) scoured the libraries of Europe in search of works by such Latin authors as Cicero, Lucretius, Livy, and Seneca. By the early 15th century, the bulk of the surviving such Latin literature had been recovered; the Greek phase of Renaissance humanism was under way, as Western European scholars turned to recovering ancient Greek literary, historical, oratorical and theological texts.Unlike with Latin texts, which had been preserved and studied in Western Europe since late antiquity, the study of ancient Greek texts was very limited in medieval Western Europe. Ancient Greek works on science, mathematics, and philosophy had been studied since the High Middle Ages in Western Europe and in the Islamic Golden Age (normally in translation), but Greek literary, oratorical and historical works (such as Homer, the Greek dramatists, Demosthenes and Thucydides) were not studied in either the Latin or medieval Islamic worlds; in the Middle Ages these sorts of texts were only studied by Byzantine scholars. Some argue that the Timurid Renaissance in Samarkand and Herat, whose magnificence toned with Florence as the center of a cultural rebirth, were linked to the Ottoman Empire, whose conquests led to the migration of Greek scholars to Italian cities. One of the greatest achievements of Renaissance scholars was to bring this entire class of Greek cultural works back into Western Europe for the first time since late antiquity.\\nMuslim logicians, most notably Avicenna and Averroes, had inherited Greek ideas after they had invaded and conquered Egypt and the Levant. Their translations and commentaries on these ideas worked their way through the Arab West into Iberia and Sicily, which became important centers for this transmission of ideas. Between the 11th and 13th centuries, many schools dedicated to the translation of philosophical and scientific works from Classical Arabic to Medieval Latin were established in Iberia, most notably the Toledo School of Translators. This work of translation from Islamic culture, though largely unplanned and disorganized, constituted one of the greatest transmissions of ideas in history.The movement to reintegrate the regular study of Greek literary, historical, oratorical, and theological texts back into the Western European curriculum is usually dated to the 1396 invitation from Coluccio Salutati to the Byzantine diplomat and scholar Manuel Chrysoloras (c. 1355–1415) to teach Greek in Florence. This legacy was continued by a number of expatriate Greek scholars, from Basilios Bessarion to Leo Allatius.\\n\\n\\n=== Social and political structures in Italy ===\\nThe unique political structures of Italy during the Late Middle Ages have led some to theorize that its unusual social climate allowed the emergence of a rare cultural efflorescence. Italy did not exist as a political entity in the early modern period. Instead, it was divided into smaller city-states and territories: the Neapolitans controlled the south, the Florentines and the Romans at the center, the Milanese and the Genoese to the north and west respectively, and the Venetians to the east. 15th-century Italy was one of the most urbanized areas in Europe. Many of its cities stood among the ruins of ancient Roman buildings; it seems likely that the classical nature of the Renaissance was linked to its origin in the Roman Empire\\'s heartland.Historian and political philosopher Quentin Skinner points out that Otto of Freising (c. 1114–1158), a German bishop visiting north Italy during the 12th century, noticed a widespread new form of political and social organization, observing that Italy appeared to have exited from feudalism so that its society was based on merchants and commerce. Linked to this was anti-monarchical thinking, represented in the famous early Renaissance fresco cycle The Allegory of Good and Bad Government by Ambrogio Lorenzetti (painted 1338–1340), whose strong message is about the virtues of fairness, justice, republicanism and good administration. Holding both Church and Empire at bay, these city republics were devoted to notions of liberty. Skinner reports that there were many defences of liberty such as the Matteo Palmieri (1406–1475) celebration of Florentine genius not only in art, sculpture and architecture, but \"the remarkable efflorescence of moral, social and political philosophy that occurred in Florence at the same time\".Even cities and states beyond central Italy, such as the Republic of Florence at this time, were also notable for their merchant republics, especially the Republic of Venice. Although in practice these were oligarchical, and bore little resemblance to a modern democracy, they did have democratic features and were responsive states, with forms of participation in governance and belief in liberty. The relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement. Likewise, the position of Italian cities such as Venice as great trading centres made them intellectual crossroads. Merchants brought with them ideas from far corners of the globe, particularly the Levant. Venice was Europe\\'s gateway to trade with the East, and a producer of fine glass, while Florence was a capital of textiles. The wealth such business brought to Italy meant large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned and individuals had more leisure time for study.\\n\\n\\n=== Black Death ===\\n\\nOne theory that has been advanced is that the devastation in Florence caused by the Black Death, which hit Europe between 1348 and 1350, resulted in a shift in the world view of people in 14th century Italy. Italy was particularly badly hit by the plague, and it has been speculated that the resulting familiarity with death caused thinkers to dwell more on their lives on Earth, rather than on spirituality and the afterlife. It has also been argued that the Black Death prompted a new wave of piety, manifested in the sponsorship of religious works of art. However, this does not fully explain why the Renaissance occurred specifically in Italy in the 14th century. The Black Death was a pandemic that affected all of Europe in the ways described, not only Italy. The Renaissance\\'s emergence in Italy was most likely the result of the complex interaction of the above factors.The plague was carried by fleas on sailing vessels returning from the ports of Asia, spreading quickly due to lack of proper sanitation: the population of England, then about 4.2 million, lost 1.4 million people to the bubonic plague. Florence\\'s population was nearly halved in the year 1347. As a result of the decimation in the populace the value of the working class increased, and commoners came to enjoy more freedom. To answer the increased need for labor, workers traveled in search of the most favorable position economically.The demographic decline due to the plague had economic consequences: the prices of food dropped and land values declined by 30–40% in most parts of Europe between 1350 and 1400. Landholders faced a great loss, but for ordinary men and women it was a windfall. The survivors of the plague found not only that the prices of food were cheaper but also that lands were more abundant, and many of them inherited property from their dead relatives.\\nThe spread of disease was significantly more rampant in areas of poverty. Epidemics ravaged cities, particularly children. Plagues were easily spread by lice, unsanitary drinking water, armies, or by poor sanitation. Children were hit the hardest because many diseases, such as typhus and congenital syphilis, target the immune system, leaving young children without a fighting chance. Children in city dwellings were more affected by the spread of disease than the children of the wealthy.The Black Death caused greater upheaval to Florence\\'s social and political structure than later epidemics. Despite a significant number of deaths among members of the ruling classes, the government of Florence continued to function during this period. Formal meetings of elected representatives were suspended during the height of the epidemic due to the chaotic conditions in the city, but a small group of officials was appointed to conduct the affairs of the city, which ensured continuity of government.\\n\\n\\n=== Cultural conditions in Florence ===\\nIt has long been a matter of debate why the Renaissance began in Florence, and not elsewhere in Italy. Scholars have noted several features unique to Florentine cultural life that may have caused such a cultural movement. Many have emphasized the role played by the Medici, a banking family and later ducal ruling house, in patronizing and stimulating the arts. Lorenzo de\\' Medici (1449–1492) was the catalyst for an enormous amount of arts patronage, encouraging his countrymen to commission works from the leading artists of Florence, including Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, and Michelangelo Buonarroti. Works by Neri di Bicci, Botticelli, da Vinci, and Filippino Lippi had been commissioned additionally by the Convent of San Donato in Scopeto in Florence.The Renaissance was certainly underway before Lorenzo de\\' Medici came to power – indeed, before the Medici family itself achieved hegemony in Florentine society. Some historians have postulated that Florence was the birthplace of the Renaissance as a result of luck, i.e., because \"Great Men\" were born there by chance: Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli and Michelangelo were all born in Tuscany. Arguing that such chance seems improbable, other historians have contended that these \"Great Men\" were only able to rise to prominence because of the prevailing cultural conditions at the time.\\n\\n\\n== Characteristics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Humanism ===\\n\\nIn some ways, Renaissance humanism was not a philosophy but a method of learning. In contrast to the medieval scholastic mode, which focused on resolving contradictions between authors, Renaissance humanists would study ancient texts in the original and appraise them through a combination of reasoning and empirical evidence. Humanist education was based on the programme of Studia Humanitatis, the study of five humanities: poetry, grammar, history, moral philosophy, and rhetoric. Although historians have sometimes struggled to define humanism precisely, most have settled on \"a middle of the road definition... the movement to recover, interpret, and assimilate the language, literature, learning and values of ancient Greece and Rome\". Above all, humanists asserted \"the genius of man ... the unique and extraordinary ability of the human mind\".\\nHumanist scholars shaped the intellectual landscape throughout the early modern period. Political philosophers such as Niccolò Machiavelli and Thomas More revived the ideas of Greek and Roman thinkers and applied them in critiques of contemporary government, following the Islamic steps of Ibn Khaldun. Pico della Mirandola wrote the \"manifesto\" of the Renaissance, the Oration on the Dignity of Man, a vibrant defence of thinking. Matteo Palmieri (1406–1475), another humanist, is most known for his work Della vita civile (\"On Civic Life\"; printed 1528), which advocated civic humanism, and for his influence in refining the Tuscan vernacular to the same level as Latin. Palmieri drew on Roman philosophers and theorists, especially Cicero, who, like Palmieri, lived an active public life as a citizen and official, as well as a theorist and philosopher and also Quintilian. Perhaps the most succinct expression of his perspective on humanism is in a 1465 poetic work La città di vita, but an earlier work, Della vita civile, is more wide-ranging. Composed as a series of dialogues set in a country house in the Mugello countryside outside Florence during the plague of 1430, Palmieri expounds on the qualities of the ideal citizen. The dialogues include ideas about how children develop mentally and physically, how citizens can conduct themselves morally, how citizens and states can ensure probity in public life, and an important debate on the difference between that which is pragmatically useful and that which is honest.The humanists believed that it is important to transcend to the afterlife with a perfect mind and body, which could be attained with education. The purpose of humanism was to create a universal man whose person combined intellectual and physical excellence and who was capable of functioning honorably in virtually any situation. This ideology was referred to as the uomo universale, an ancient Greco-Roman ideal. Education during the Renaissance was mainly composed of ancient literature and history as it was thought that the classics provided moral instruction and an intensive understanding of human behavior.\\n\\n\\n=== Humanism and libraries ===\\nA unique characteristic of some Renaissance libraries is that they were open to the public. These libraries were places where ideas were exchanged and where scholarship and reading were considered both pleasurable and beneficial to the mind and soul. As freethinking was a hallmark of the age, many libraries contained a wide range of writers. Classical texts could be found alongside humanist writings. These informal associations of intellectuals profoundly influenced Renaissance culture. Some of the richest \"bibliophiles\" built libraries as temples to books and knowledge. A number of libraries appeared as manifestations of immense wealth joined with a love of books. In some cases, cultivated library builders were also committed to offering others the opportunity to use their collections. Prominent aristocrats and princes of the Church created great libraries for the use of their courts, called \"court libraries\", and were housed in lavishly designed monumental buildings decorated with ornate woodwork, and the walls adorned with frescoes (Murray, Stuart A.P.).\\n\\n\\n=== Art ===\\n\\nRenaissance art marks a cultural rebirth at the close of the Middle Ages and rise of the Modern world. One of the distinguishing features of Renaissance art was its development of highly realistic linear perspective. Giotto di Bondone (1267–1337) is credited with first treating a painting as a window into space, but it was not until the demonstrations of architect Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1446) and the subsequent writings of Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472) that perspective was formalized as an artistic technique.\\nThe development of perspective was part of a wider trend toward realism in the arts. Painters developed other techniques, studying light, shadow, and, famously in the case of Leonardo da Vinci, human anatomy. Underlying these changes in artistic method was a renewed desire to depict the beauty of nature and to unravel the axioms of aesthetics, with the works of Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael representing artistic pinnacles that were much imitated by other artists. Other notable artists include Sandro Botticelli, working for the Medici in Florence, Donatello, another Florentine, and Titian in Venice, among others.\\nIn the Netherlands, a particularly vibrant artistic culture developed. The work of Hugo van der Goes and Jan van Eyck was particularly influential on the development of painting in Italy, both technically with the introduction of oil paint and canvas, and stylistically in terms of naturalism in representation. Later, the work of Pieter Brueghel the Elder would inspire artists to depict themes of everyday life.In architecture, Filippo Brunelleschi was foremost in studying the remains of ancient classical buildings. With rediscovered knowledge from the 1st-century writer Vitruvius and the flourishing discipline of mathematics, Brunelleschi formulated the Renaissance style that emulated and improved on classical forms. His major feat of engineering was building the dome of the Florence Cathedral. Another building demonstrating this style is the church of St. Andrew in Mantua, built by Alberti. The outstanding architectural work of the High Renaissance was the rebuilding of St. Peter\\'s Basilica, combining the skills of Bramante, Michelangelo, Raphael, Sangallo and Maderno.\\nDuring the Renaissance, architects aimed to use columns, pilasters, and entablatures as an integrated system. The Roman orders types of columns are used: Tuscan and Composite. These can either be structural, supporting an arcade or architrave, or purely decorative, set against a wall in the form of pilasters. One of the first buildings to use pilasters as an integrated system was in the Old Sacristy (1421–1440) by Brunelleschi. Arches, semi-circular or (in the Mannerist style) segmental, are often used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals. There may be a section of entablature between the capital and the springing of the arch. Alberti was one of the first to use the arch on a monumental. Renaissance vaults do not have ribs; they are semi-circular or segmental and on a square plan, unlike the Gothic vault, which is frequently rectangular.\\nRenaissance artists were not pagans, although they admired antiquity and kept some ideas and symbols of the medieval past. Nicola Pisano (c. 1220 – c. 1278) imitated classical forms by portraying scenes from the Bible. His Annunciation, from the Baptistry at Pisa, demonstrates that classical models influenced Italian art before the Renaissance took root as a literary movement.\\n\\n\\n=== Science ===\\n\\nApplied innovation extended to commerce. At the end of the 15th century, Luca Pacioli published the first work on bookkeeping, making him the founder of accounting.The rediscovery of ancient texts and the invention of the printing press in about 1440 democratized learning and allowed a faster propagation of more widely distributed ideas. In the first period of the Italian Renaissance, humanists favored the study of humanities over natural philosophy or applied mathematics, and their reverence for classical sources further enshrined the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic views of the universe. Writing around 1450, Nicholas Cusanus anticipated the heliocentric worldview of Copernicus, but in a philosophical fashion.\\nScience and art were intermingled in the early Renaissance, with polymath artists such as Leonardo da Vinci making observational drawings of anatomy and nature. Leonardo set up controlled experiments in water flow, medical dissection, and systematic study of movement and aerodynamics, and he devised principles of research method that led Fritjof Capra to classify him as the \"father of modern science\". Other examples of Da Vinci\\'s contribution during this period include machines designed to saw marbles and lift monoliths, and new discoveries in acoustics, botany, geology, anatomy, and mechanics.A suitable environment had developed to question classical scientific doctrine. The discovery in 1492 of the New World by Christopher Columbus challenged the classical worldview. The works of Ptolemy (in geography) and Galen (in medicine) were found to not always match everyday observations. As the Reformation and Counter-Reformation clashed, the Northern Renaissance showed a decisive shift in focus from Aristotelean natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine). The willingness to question previously held truths and search for new answers resulted in a period of major scientific advancements.\\nSome view this as a \"scientific revolution\", heralding the beginning of the modern age, others as an acceleration of a continuous process stretching from the ancient world to the present day. Significant scientific advances were made during this time by Galileo Galilei, Tycho Brahe, and Johannes Kepler. Copernicus, in De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres), posited that the Earth moved around the Sun. De humani corporis fabrica (On the Workings of the Human Body) by Andreas Vesalius, gave a new confidence to the role of dissection, observation, and the mechanistic view of anatomy.Another important development was in the process for discovery, the scientific method, focusing on empirical evidence and the importance of mathematics, while discarding much of Aristotelian science. Early and influential proponents of these ideas included Copernicus, Galileo, and Francis Bacon. The new scientific method led to great contributions in the fields of astronomy, physics, biology, and anatomy.\\n\\n\\n=== Navigation and geography ===\\n\\nDuring the Renaissance, extending from 1450 to 1650, every continent was visited and mostly mapped by Europeans, except the south polar continent now known as Antarctica. This development is depicted in the large world map Nova Totius Terrarum Orbis Tabula made by the Dutch cartographer Joan Blaeu in 1648 to commemorate the Peace of Westphalia.\\nIn 1492, Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean from Spain seeking a direct route to India of the Delhi Sultanate. He accidentally stumbled upon the Americas, but believed he had reached the East Indies.\\nIn 1606, the Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon sailed from the East Indies in the VOC ship Duyfken and landed in Australia. He charted about 300 km of the west coast of Cape York Peninsula in Queensland. More than thirty Dutch expeditions followed, mapping sections of the north, west, and south coasts. In 1642–1643, Abel Tasman circumnavigated the continent, proving that it was not joined to the imagined south polar continent.\\nBy 1650, Dutch cartographers had mapped most of the coastline of the continent, which they named New Holland, except the east coast which was charted in 1770 by James Cook.\\nThe long-imagined south polar continent was eventually sighted in 1820. Throughout the Renaissance it had been known as Terra Australis, or \\'Australia\\' for short. However, after that name was transferred to New Holland in the nineteenth century, the new name of \\'Antarctica\\' was bestowed on the south polar continent.\\n\\n\\n=== Music ===\\n\\nFrom this changing society emerged a common, unifying musical language, in particular the polyphonic style of the Franco-Flemish school. The development of printing made distribution of music possible on a wide scale. Demand for music as entertainment and as an activity for educated amateurs increased with the emergence of a bourgeois class. Dissemination of chansons, motets, and masses throughout Europe coincided with the unification of polyphonic practice into the fluid style that culminated in the second half of the sixteenth century in the work of composers such as Palestrina, Lassus, Victoria, and William Byrd.\\n\\n\\n=== Religion ===\\n\\nThe new ideals of humanism, although more secular in some aspects, developed against a Christian backdrop, especially in the Northern Renaissance. Much, if not most, of the new art was commissioned by or in dedication to the Church. However, the Renaissance had a profound effect on contemporary theology, particularly in the way people perceived the relationship between man and God. Many of the period\\'s foremost theologians were followers of the humanist method, including Erasmus, Huldrych Zwingli, Thomas More, Martin Luther, and John Calvin.\\n\\nThe Renaissance began in times of religious turmoil. The Late Middle Ages was a period of political intrigue surrounding the Papacy, culminating in the Western Schism, in which three men simultaneously claimed to be true Bishop of Rome. While the schism was resolved by the Council of Constance (1414), a resulting reform movement known as Conciliarism sought to limit the power of the pope. Although the papacy eventually emerged supreme in ecclesiastical matters by the Fifth Council of the Lateran (1511), it was dogged by continued accusations of corruption, most famously in the person of Pope Alexander VI, who was accused variously of simony, nepotism, and fathering children (most of whom were married off, presumably for the consolidation of power) while a cardinal.Churchmen such as Erasmus and Luther proposed reform to the Church, often based on humanist textual criticism of the New Testament. In October 1517, Luther published the Ninety-five Theses, challenging papal authority and criticizing its perceived corruption, particularly with regard to instances of sold indulgences. The 95 Theses led to the Reformation, a break with the Roman Catholic Church that previously claimed hegemony in Western Europe. Humanism and the Renaissance therefore played a direct role in sparking the Reformation, as well as in many other contemporaneous religious debates and conflicts.\\nPope Paul III came to the papal throne (1534–1549) after the sack of Rome in 1527, with uncertainties prevalent in the Catholic Church following the Reformation. Nicolaus Copernicus dedicated De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres) to Paul III, who became the grandfather of Alessandro Farnese, who had paintings by Titian, Michelangelo, and Raphael, as well as an important collection of drawings, and who commissioned the masterpiece of Giulio Clovio, arguably the last major illuminated manuscript, the Farnese Hours.\\n\\n\\n=== Self-awareness ===\\nBy the 15th century, writers, artists, and architects in Italy were well aware of the transformations that were taking place and were using phrases such as modi antichi (in the antique manner) or alle romana et alla antica (in the manner of the Romans and the ancients) to describe their work. In the 1330s Petrarch referred to pre-Christian times as antiqua (ancient) and to the Christian period as nova (new). From Petrarch\\'s Italian perspective, this new period (which included his own time) was an age of national eclipse.Leonardo Bruni was the first to use tripartite periodization in his History of the Florentine People (1442). Bruni\\'s first two periods were based on those of Petrarch, but he added a third period because he believed that Italy was no longer in a state of decline. Flavio Biondo used a similar framework in Decades of History from the Deterioration of the Roman Empire (1439–1453).\\nHumanist historians argued that contemporary scholarship restored direct links to the classical period, thus bypassing the Medieval period, which they then named for the first time the \"Middle Ages\". The term first appears in Latin in 1469 as media tempestas (middle times). The term rinascita (rebirth) first appeared, however, in its broad sense in Giorgio Vasari\\'s Lives of the Artists, 1550, revised 1568. Vasari divides the age into three phases: the first phase contains Cimabue, Giotto, and Arnolfo di Cambio; the second phase contains Masaccio, Brunelleschi, and Donatello; the third centers on Leonardo da Vinci and culminates with Michelangelo. It was not just the growing awareness of classical antiquity that drove this development, according to Vasari, but also the growing desire to study and imitate nature.\\n\\n\\n== Spread ==\\nIn the 15th century, the Renaissance spread rapidly from its birthplace in Florence to the rest of Italy and soon to the rest of Europe. The invention of the printing press by German printer Johannes Gutenberg allowed the rapid transmission of these new ideas. As it spread, its ideas diversified and changed, being adapted to local culture. In the 20th century, scholars began to break the Renaissance into regional and national movements.\\n\\n\\n=== England ===\\n\\nRenaissance style and ideas were slow to penetrate England, and the Elizabethan era in the second half of the 16th century is usually regarded as the height of the English Renaissance. Many scholars see its beginnings in the early 16th century during the reign of Henry VIII.The English Renaissance is different from the Italian Renaissance in several ways. The dominant art forms of the English Renaissance were literature and music. Visual arts in the English Renaissance were much less significant than in the Italian Renaissance. The English Renaissance period in art began far later than the Italian, which had moved into Mannerism by the 1530s.\\nIn literature the later part of the 16th century saw the flowering of Elizabethan literature, with poetry heavily influenced by Italian Renaissance literature but Elizabethan theatre a distinctive native style. Writers include William Shakespeare (1564–1616), Christopher Marlowe (1564–593), Edmund Spenser (1552/1553–599), Sir Thomas More (1478–1535), Francis Bacon (1561–1626), and Sir Philip Sidney (1554–1586). English Renaissance music competed with that in Europe with composers such as Thomas Tallis (1505–1585), John Taverner (c. 1490–1545), and William Byrd (c. 1539/40 or 1543–1623).  Elizabethan architecture produced the large prodigy houses of courtiers, and in the next century Inigo Jones (1573–1652), who introduced Italianate architecture to England.\\n\\n\\n=== France ===\\n\\nThe word \"Renaissance\" is borrowed from the French language, where it means \"re-birth\". It was first used in the eighteenth century and was later popularized by French historian Jules Michelet (1798–1874) in his 1855 work, Histoire de France (History of France).In 1495 the Italian Renaissance arrived in France, imported by King Charles VIII after his invasion of Italy. A factor that promoted the spread of secularism was the inability of the Church to offer assistance against the Black Death. Francis I imported Italian art and artists, including Leonardo da Vinci, and built ornate palaces at great expense. Writers such as François Rabelais, Pierre de Ronsard, Joachim du Bellay, and Michel de Montaigne, painters such as Jean Clouet, and musicians such as Jean Mouton also borrowed from the spirit of the Renaissance.\\nIn 1533, a fourteen-year-old Caterina de\\' Medici (1519–1589), born in Florence to Lorenzo de\\' Medici, Duke of Urbino and Madeleine de la Tour d\\'Auvergne, married Henry II of France, second son of King Francis I and Queen Claude. Though she became famous and infamous for her role in France\\'s religious wars, she made a direct contribution in bringing arts, sciences, and music (including the origins of ballet) to the French court from her native Florence.\\n\\n\\n=== Germany ===\\n\\nIn the second half of the 15th century, the Renaissance spirit spread to Germany and the Low Countries, where the development of the printing press (ca. 1450) and Renaissance artists such as Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) predated the influence from Italy. In the early Protestant areas of the country humanism became closely linked to the turmoil of the Reformation, and the art and writing of the German Renaissance frequently reflected this dispute. However, the Gothic style and medieval scholastic philosophy remained exclusively until the turn of the 16th century. Emperor Maximilian I of Habsburg (ruling 1493–1519) was the first truly Renaissance monarch of the Holy Roman Empire.\\n\\n\\n=== Hungarian trecento and quattrocento ===\\n\\nAfter Italy, Hungary was the first European country where the Renaissance appeared. The Renaissance style came directly from Italy during the Quattrocento (1400s) to Hungary first in the Central European region, thanks to the development of early Hungarian-Italian relationships — not only in dynastic connections, but also in cultural, humanistic and commercial relations – growing in strength from the 14th century. The relationship between Hungarian and Italian Gothic styles was a second reason – exaggerated breakthrough of walls is avoided, preferring clean and light structures. Large-scale building schemes provided ample and long term work for the artists, for example, the building of the Friss (New) Castle in Buda, the castles of Visegrád, Tata, and Várpalota. In Sigismund\\'s court there were patrons such as Pipo Spano, a descendant of the Scolari family of Florence, who invited Manetto Ammanatini and Masolino da Pannicale to Hungary.The new Italian trend combined with existing national traditions to create a particular local Renaissance art. Acceptance of Renaissance art was furthered by the continuous arrival of humanist thought in the country. Many young Hungarians studying at Italian universities came closer to the Florentine humanist center, so a direct connection with Florence evolved. The growing number of Italian traders moving to Hungary, specially to Buda, helped this process. New thoughts were carried by the humanist prelates, among them Vitéz János, archbishop of Esztergom, one of the founders of Hungarian humanism. During the long reign of emperor Sigismund of Luxemburg the Royal Castle of Buda became probably the largest Gothic palace of the late Middle Ages. King Matthias Corvinus (r. 1458–1490) rebuilt the palace in early Renaissance style and further expanded it.After the marriage in 1476 of King Matthias to Beatrice of Naples, Buda became one of the most important artistic centers of the Renaissance north of the Alps. The most important humanists living in Matthias\\' court were Antonio Bonfini and the famous Hungarian poet Janus Pannonius. András Hess set up a printing press in Buda in 1472. Matthias Corvinus\\'s library, the Bibliotheca Corviniana, was Europe\\'s greatest collections of secular books: historical chronicles, philosophic and scientific works in the 15th century. His library was second only in size to the Vatican Library. (However, the Vatican Library mainly contained Bibles and religious materials.) In 1489, Bartolomeo della Fonte of Florence wrote that Lorenzo de\\' Medici founded his own Greek-Latin library encouraged by the example of the Hungarian king. Corvinus\\'s library is part of UNESCO World Heritage.Matthias started at least two major building projects. The works in Buda and Visegrád began in about 1479. Two new wings and a hanging garden were built at the royal castle of Buda, and the palace at Visegrád was rebuilt in Renaissance style. Matthias appointed the Italian Chimenti Camicia and the Dalmatian Giovanni Dalmata to direct these projects.  Matthias commissioned the leading Italian artists of his age to embellish his palaces: for instance, the sculptor Benedetto da Majano and the painters Filippino Lippi and Andrea Mantegna worked for him. A copy of Mantegna\\'s portrait of Matthias survived. Matthias also hired the Italian military engineer Aristotele Fioravanti to direct the rebuilding of the forts along the southern frontier. He had new monasteries built in Late Gothic style for the Franciscans in Kolozsvár, Szeged and Hunyad, and for the Paulines in Fejéregyháza.  In the spring of 1485, Leonardo da Vinci travelled to Hungary on behalf of Sforza to meet king Matthias Corvinus, and was commissioned by him to paint a Madonna.Matthias enjoyed the company of Humanists and had lively discussions on various topics with them. The fame of his magnanimity encouraged many scholars—mostly Italian—to settle in Buda. Antonio Bonfini, Pietro Ranzano, Bartolomeo Fonzio, and Francesco Bandini spent many years in Matthias\\'s court. This circle of educated men introduced the ideas of Neoplatonism to Hungary. Like all intellectuals of his age, Matthias was convinced that the movements and combinations of the stars and planets exercised influence on individuals\\' life and on the history of nations. Galeotto Marzio described him as \"king and astrologer\", and Antonio Bonfini said Matthias \"never did anything without consulting the stars\". Upon his request, the famous astronomers of the age, Johannes Regiomontanus and Marcin Bylica, set up an observatory in Buda and installed it with astrolabes and celestial globes. Regiomontanus dedicated his book on navigation that was used by Christopher Columbus to Matthias.Other important figures of Hungarian Renaissance include Bálint Balassi (poet), Sebestyén Tinódi Lantos (poet), Bálint Bakfark (composer and lutenist), and Master MS (fresco painter).\\n\\n\\n=== Renaissance in the Low Countries ===\\n\\nCulture in the Netherlands at the end of the 15th century was influenced by the Italian Renaissance through trade via Bruges, which made Flanders wealthy. Its nobles commissioned artists who became known across Europe. In science, the anatomist Andreas Vesalius led the way; in cartography, Gerardus Mercator\\'s map assisted explorers and navigators. In art, Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting ranged from the strange work of Hieronymus Bosch to the everyday life depictions of Pieter Brueghel the Elder.Erasmus was arguably the Netherlands\\' best known humanist and Catholic intellectual during the Renaissance.\\n\\n\\n=== Northern Europe ===\\n\\nThe Renaissance in Northern Europe has been termed the \"Northern Renaissance\". While Renaissance ideas were moving north from Italy, there was a simultaneous southward spread of some areas of innovation, particularly in music. The music of the 15th-century Burgundian School defined the beginning of the Renaissance in music, and the polyphony of the Netherlanders, as it moved with the musicians themselves into Italy, formed the core of the first true international style in music since the standardization of Gregorian Chant in the 9th century. The culmination of the Netherlandish school was in the music of the Italian composer Palestrina. At the end of the 16th century Italy again became a center of musical innovation, with the development of the polychoral style of the Venetian School, which spread northward into Germany around 1600. In Denmark, the Renaissance sparked the translation of the works of Saxo Grammaticus into Danish as well as Frederick II and Christian IV ordering the redecoration or construction of several important works of architecture, i.e. Kronborg, Rosenborg and Børsen. Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe greatly contributed to turn astronomy into the first modern science and also helped launch the Scientific Revolution.The paintings of the Italian Renaissance differed from those of the Northern Renaissance. Italian Renaissance artists were among the first to paint secular scenes, breaking away from the purely religious art of medieval painters. Northern Renaissance artists initially remained focused on religious subjects, such as the contemporary religious upheaval portrayed by Albrecht Dürer. Later, the works of Pieter Bruegel influenced artists to paint scenes of daily life rather than religious or classical themes. It was also during the Northern Renaissance that Flemish brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck perfected the oil painting technique, which enabled artists to produce strong colors on a hard surface that could survive for centuries. A feature of the Northern Renaissance was its use of the vernacular in place of Latin or Greek, which allowed greater freedom of expression. This movement had started in Italy with the decisive influence of Dante Alighieri on the development of vernacular languages; in fact the focus on writing in Italian has neglected a major source of Florentine ideas expressed in Latin. The spread of the printing press technology boosted the Renaissance in Northern Europe as elsewhere, with Venice becoming a world center of printing.\\n\\n\\n=== Poland ===\\n\\nAn early Italian humanist who came to Poland in the mid-15th century was Filippo Buonaccorsi. Many Italian artists came to Poland with Bona Sforza of Milan, when she married King Sigismund I in 1518. This was supported by temporarily strengthened monarchies in both areas, as well as by newly established universities. The Polish Renaissance lasted from the late 15th to the late 16th century and was the Golden Age of Polish culture. Ruled by the Jagiellonian dynasty, the Kingdom of Poland (from 1569 known as the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) actively participated in the broad European Renaissance. The multi-national Polish state experienced a substantial period of cultural growth thanks in part to a century without major wars – aside from conflicts in the sparsely populated eastern and southern borderlands. The Reformation spread peacefully throughout the country (giving rise to the Polish Brethren), while living conditions improved, cities grew, and exports of agricultural products enriched the population, especially the nobility (szlachta) who gained dominance in the new political system of Golden Liberty. The Polish Renaissance architecture has three periods of development.\\nThe greatest monument of this style in the territory of the former Duchy of Pomerania is the Ducal Castle in Szczecin.\\n\\n\\n=== Portugal ===\\n\\nAlthough Italian Renaissance had a modest impact in Portuguese arts, Portugal was influential in broadening the European worldview, stimulating humanist inquiry. Renaissance arrived through the influence of wealthy Italian and Flemish merchants who invested in the profitable commerce overseas. As the pioneer headquarters of European exploration, Lisbon flourished in the late 15th century, attracting experts who made several breakthroughs in mathematics, astronomy and naval technology, including Pedro Nunes, João de Castro, Abraham Zacuto, and Martin Behaim. Cartographers Pedro Reinel, Lopo Homem, Estêvão Gomes, and Diogo Ribeiro made crucial advances in mapping the world. Apothecary Tomé Pires and physicians Garcia de Orta and Cristóvão da Costa collected and published works on plants and medicines, soon translated by Flemish pioneer botanist Carolus Clusius.\\n\\nIn architecture, the huge profits of the spice trade financed a sumptuous composite style in the first decades of the 16th century, the Manueline, incorporating maritime elements. The primary painters were Nuno Gonçalves, Gregório Lopes, and Vasco Fernandes. In music, Pedro de Escobar and Duarte Lobo produced four songbooks, including the Cancioneiro de Elvas. In literature, Sá de Miranda introduced Italian forms of verse. Bernardim Ribeiro developed pastoral romance, plays by Gil Vicente fused it with popular culture, reporting the changing times, and Luís de Camões inscribed the Portuguese feats overseas in the epic poem Os Lusíadas. Travel literature especially flourished: João de Barros, Castanheda, António Galvão, Gaspar Correia, Duarte Barbosa, and Fernão Mendes Pinto, among others, described new lands and were translated and spread with the new printing press. After joining the Portuguese exploration of Brazil in 1500, Amerigo Vespucci coined the term New World, in his letters to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de\\' Medici.\\nThe intense international exchange produced several cosmopolitan humanist scholars, including Francisco de Holanda, André de Resende, and Damião de Góis, a friend of Erasmus who wrote with rare independence on the reign of King Manuel I. Diogo and André de Gouveia made relevant teaching reforms via France. Foreign news and products in the Portuguese factory in Antwerp attracted the interest of Thomas More and Albrecht Dürer to the wider world. There, profits and know-how helped nurture the Dutch Renaissance and Golden Age, especially after the arrival of the wealthy cultured Jewish community expelled from Portugal.\\n\\n\\n=== Spain ===\\n\\nThe Renaissance arrived in the Iberian peninsula through the Mediterranean possessions of the Aragonese Crown and the city of Valencia. Many early Spanish Renaissance writers come from the Kingdom of Aragon, including Ausiàs March and Joanot Martorell. In the Kingdom of Castile, the early Renaissance was heavily influenced by the Italian humanism, starting with writers and poets such as the Marquis of Santillana, who introduced the new Italian poetry to Spain in the early 15th century. Other writers, such as Jorge Manrique, Fernando de Rojas, Juan del Encina, Juan Boscán Almogáver, and Garcilaso de la Vega, kept a close resemblance to the Italian canon. Miguel de Cervantes\\'s masterpiece Don Quixote is credited as the first Western novel. Renaissance humanism flourished in the early 16th century, with influential writers such as philosopher Juan Luis Vives, grammarian Antonio de Nebrija and natural historian Pedro de Mexía.\\nLater Spanish Renaissance tended toward religious themes and mysticism, with poets such as Luis de León, Teresa of Ávila, and John of the Cross, and treated issues related to the exploration of the New World, with chroniclers and writers such as Inca Garcilaso de la Vega and Bartolomé de las Casas, giving rise to a body of work, now known as Spanish Renaissance literature. The late Renaissance in Spain produced artists such as El Greco and composers such as Tomás Luis de Victoria and Antonio de Cabezón.\\n\\n\\n=== Further countries ===\\nRenaissance in Croatia\\nRenaissance in Scotland\\n\\n\\n== Historiography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Conception ===\\nThe Italian artist and critic Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574) first used the term rinascita in his book The Lives of the Artists (published 1550). In the book Vasari attempted to define what he described as a break with the barbarities of Gothic art: the arts (he held) had fallen into decay with the collapse of the Roman Empire and only the Tuscan artists, beginning with Cimabue (1240–1301) and Giotto (1267–1337) began to reverse this decline in the arts. Vasari saw ancient art as central to the rebirth of Italian art.However, only in the 19th century did the French word renaissance achieve popularity in describing the self-conscious cultural movement based on revival of Roman models that began in the late 13th century. French historian Jules Michelet (1798–1874) defined \"The Renaissance\" in his 1855 work Histoire de France as an entire historical period, whereas previously it had been used in a more limited sense. For Michelet, the Renaissance was more a development in science than in art and culture. He asserted that it spanned the period from Columbus to Copernicus to Galileo; that is, from the end of the 15th century to the middle of the 17th century. Moreover, Michelet distinguished between what he called, \"the bizarre and monstrous\" quality of the Middle Ages and the democratic values that he, as a vocal Republican, chose to see in its character. A French nationalist, Michelet also sought to claim the Renaissance as a French movement.The Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt (1818–1897) in his The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy (1860), by contrast, defined the Renaissance as the period between Giotto and Michelangelo in Italy, that is, the 14th to mid-16th centuries. He saw in the Renaissance the emergence of the modern spirit of individuality, which the Middle Ages had stifled. His book was widely read and became influential in the development of the modern interpretation of the Italian Renaissance.More recently, some historians have been much less keen to define the Renaissance as a historical age, or even as a coherent cultural movement. The historian Randolph Starn, of the University of California Berkeley, stated in 1998:\\n\\nRather than a period with definitive beginnings and endings and consistent content in between, the Renaissance can be (and occasionally has been) seen as a movement of practices and ideas to which specific groups and identifiable persons variously responded in different times and places. It would be in this sense a network of diverse, sometimes converging, sometimes conflicting cultures, not a single, time-bound culture.\\n\\n\\n=== Debates about progress ===\\n\\nThere is debate about the extent to which the Renaissance improved on the culture of the Middle Ages. Both Michelet and Burckhardt were keen to describe the progress made in the Renaissance toward the modern age. Burckhardt likened the change to a veil being removed from man\\'s eyes, allowing him to see clearly.\\nIn the Middle Ages both sides of human consciousness – that which was turned within as that which was turned without – lay dreaming or half awake beneath a common veil. The veil was woven of faith, illusion, and childish prepossession, through which the world and history were seen clad in strange hues.\\nOn the other hand, many historians now point out that most of the negative social factors popularly associated with the medieval period – poverty, warfare, religious and political persecution, for example – seem to have worsened in this era, which saw the rise of Machiavellian politics, the Wars of Religion, the corrupt Borgia Popes, and the intensified witch-hunts of the 16th century. Many people who lived during the Renaissance did not view it as the \"golden age\" imagined by certain 19th-century authors, but were concerned by these social maladies. Significantly, though, the artists, writers, and patrons involved in the cultural movements in question believed they were living in a new era that was a clean break from the Middle Ages. Some Marxist historians prefer to describe the Renaissance in material terms, holding the view that the changes in art, literature, and philosophy were part of a general economic trend from feudalism toward capitalism, resulting in a bourgeois class with leisure time to devote to the arts.Johan Huizinga (1872–1945) acknowledged the existence of the Renaissance but questioned whether it was a positive change. In his book The Autumn of the Middle Ages, he argued that the Renaissance was a period of decline from the High Middle Ages, destroying much that was important. The Medieval Latin language, for instance, had evolved greatly from the classical period and was still a living language used in the church and elsewhere. The Renaissance obsession with classical purity halted its further evolution and saw Latin revert to its classical form. This view is however somewhat contested by recent studies. Robert S. Lopez has contended that it was a period of deep economic recession. Meanwhile, George Sarton and Lynn Thorndike have both argued that scientific progress was perhaps less original than has traditionally been supposed. Finally, Joan Kelly argued that the Renaissance led to greater gender dichotomy, lessening the agency women had had during the Middle Ages.Some historians have begun to consider the word Renaissance to be unnecessarily loaded, implying an unambiguously positive rebirth from the supposedly more primitive \"Dark Ages\", the Middle Ages. Most political and economic historians now prefer to use the term \"early modern\" for this period (and a considerable period afterwards), a designation intended to highlight the period as a transitional one between the Middle Ages and the modern era. Others such as Roger Osborne have come to consider the Italian Renaissance as a repository of the myths and ideals of western history in general, and instead of rebirth of ancient ideas as a period of great innovation.The art historian Erwin Panofsky observed of this resistance to the concept of \"Renaissance\":\\n\\nIt is perhaps no accident that the factuality of the Italian Renaissance has been most vigorously questioned by those who are not obliged to take a professional interest in the aesthetic aspects of civilization – historians of economic and social developments, political and religious situations, and, most particularly, natural science – but only exceptionally by students of literature and hardly ever by historians of Art.\\n\\n\\n== Other Renaissances ==\\nThe term Renaissance has also been used to define periods outside of the 15th and 16th centuries. Charles H. Haskins (1870–1937), for example, made a case for a Renaissance of the 12th century. Other historians have argued for a Carolingian Renaissance in the 8th and 9th centuries, Ottonian Renaissance in the 10th century and for the Timurid Renaissance of the 14th century. The Islamic Golden Age has been also sometimes termed with the Islamic Renaissance. The Macedonian Renaissance is a term used for a period in the Roman Empire in the 9th-11th centuries CE. \\nOther periods of cultural rebirth have also been termed \"renaissances\", such as the Bengal Renaissance, Tamil Renaissance, Nepal Bhasa renaissance, al-Nahda or the Harlem Renaissance. The term can also be used in cinema. In animation, the Disney Renaissance is a period that spanned the years from 1989 to 1999 which saw the studio return to the level of quality not witnessed since their Golden Age of Animation. The San Francisco Renaissance was a vibrant period of exploratory poetry and fiction writing in that city in the mid-20th century.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nIndex of Renaissance articles\\nOutline of the Renaissance\\nList of Renaissance figures\\nList of Renaissance structures\\nRoman Renaissance\\nVenetian Renaissance\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Explanatory notes ===\\n\\n\\n=== Citations ===\\n\\n\\n=== General sources ===\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\\n\\n=== Historiography ===\\n\\n\\n=== Primary sources ===\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\n\"The Renaissance\" episode of In Our Time, a BBC Radio 4 discussion with Francis Ames-Lewis, Peter Burke and Evelyn Welch (June 8, 2000).\\nSymonds, John Addington (1911). \"Renaissance, The\" .

comejoin us livethere we go world champion Bunga Perkinshim and uh Freddy hoie hoie came overwith their beautiful Ohana to come surfpipeline I get excited all the time whenyou see banga because a lot of usgrowing up in the longboard World we\\'dall try to emulate this guy right guyit\\'s not just a longboarder heshortboards really good and can ride abodyboard professionally in Japan andall around the world when we\\'re gromsand he\\'ll be in the next seat yeah bongaand I are the same age actually and uh Iremember you know I grew up on the bigisland in Hilo and uh when I was surfingcompetitively when I was a teenagercoming up and we surfed against eachother in the you know the statecompetition but he was on a shortboardright Anda it always blew my mind thathe could win three divisions in one dayfrom shortboard to body board tolongboard I don\\'t think a lot of peopleknew that but he was like one of the topbody boarders back was younger heactually went to Japan and there was atour upthere and and of course I think bongaespecially like in the \\'90s and the2000s kind of kind of made a new kind ofstandard for for surfing back door on along board you know surfing at Pipelineand back door um you know the wave is sosteep that having that extra couple offeet on your board makes it challengingto to get into but bonger really I thinkshowed us what is possible on alongboard at Pipeline and back door umand so he\\'s you know still at it yeah heput in his time so much he you could seeas he was beginning to do it he justcreated how his flow and how to slowdown cuz on a longboard once you catch amountain like this at pipeline you\\'reflying so that is part of the wholething on a longboard is trying to adjustnavigate your Rail and slow down that 9flot longboard plus he\\'s always has sucha really cool style you know reallysmooth andum and something interesting too I thinkyou know mostly with with Hawaii Surferswho ride longboard they they can surf itas a shortboard or as a log you knowkind of slow it down and you knowbecause on the new longboard tour I seea lot of my friends that are high probut they do log they rip so hard but youcan see them as they\\'re going on theirlog doing a radical Hawaiian cutbackthey got to remind themselves oh andthen I see them bust out the magic handshove out the hip a little bit do thesoul tradition but then

year at the backo door shootoutat the infamous Bonsai pipeline righthere at the infamous Jerry Lopez houseit\\'s now the hcom house so much Richhistory right here surfing this is whereeverybody comes to prove themselves andwe got the first heat of longboardingout in the lineup and we got a paddlerIsaiah we do looking for this insidedouble up at back door it\\'s not notgoing to materializeso opt not to catch that wave we do havea rising swell and um exciting to seethese longboarders out here as you cansee paddling out in our next Heat KeeganEdwards bonga Perkins kamak fith ZackHoward o heavy heat is a heavy heat andhere at the back door shootout you knowwe celebrate the variety of ways ofriding waves on act on different typesof craft yeah and um so we gotlongboards and we\\'vegot standup surfing and this is the UdukKahanamoku uh specialty events so fromlongboard standup paddle and possiblybody surfing we are always in memory ofDuke Kahanamoku not just for his Olympicmedals he was so much more to a lot ofus Surfers and to our our PacificCommunity rightright look like we got two paddlers forthis one looks like ha Foster Bloomfieldup andout oo so right around this point rightnow as Scotty Fong and makco ho have onewave each these guys are going to haveto get youknow every Surfer needs to do that at atime it\\'s like okay I\\'m not going to getthe Apex set wave now I got to goshopping and I tell a lot of surferssometimes when you shop to long you canturn off and here wego grabbingrail going left believe that was ScottyFong let\\'s double check here so farScotty he had one wave at back doorwhere he got a little cover up for aquick second mhm andso there hasn\\'t been that\\'s good he\\'sturning in two scores and that\\'s whatyou need to do to play sometimes if youcan\\'t get the big pipe Barrel or theback door you got to gravel on theinside and put something on that paperas we have an amazing judging panel I\\'llget to that later Scotty Fong spinningaround stalling gets in the tube andgoes right into that rib Isaiah Sam barthat\\'s why yeah very shallow spot rightthere on the inside of of back door anduh looked like he had it but then thebottom kind of dropped out of him youcan see how that extra couple feet onthe surfboard make it a little tricky toum avoidwhat we call pearling or nose diving manhe was on his way come out of that thingbut ran off theet little rib justgrabbed right onto his Shopper nose andhully Maka flip Scotty f up running offof the board like a like a diving boardyeah love traveling with that guy theguy is an amazing Surfer Scotty Fongsuper humble real talented yeah seeright of all trades restaurant ownerdoctor pilot wow yeah bounces back andforth from Maui to aahu got to see themat the Fourth of July at the hoie paddleboardrace he went with his two boys and hiswife and that was awesome Scotty Fonggood to have you herebuddy and thank you to guts Hawaii andKiki beachbungalows Scotty Fong is definitelytaking advantage of this Heat goingbecause you know sometimes that\\'s thebest thing to do like you know everySurfer has their different plot and waythey play the Heat some people actdifferent once the horn blows you knowwhat I mean and uh but to get busy andstay busy is sometimes better in a slowheat with 407remaining yeah you\\'re right um you knowoften times I mean this is a competitionand even though there\\'s a lot ofcamaraderie and especially we\\'ll seelater in the in the team divisionthere\\'s trying to help each other outbut at the same time when there\\'s threeminutes left on the clock and you need awave to advance uh you\\'re right you wantto try and get busy as possible becauseat this point the scores are uh prettylow we haven\\'t had any real you knowwaves in the excellent scoring rangejust yet so I think one good wave couldturn the heat in the next 3 minutes and30seconds oh wow everybody\\'s tuning infrom around the world we got New Zealandwhat\\'s up NewZealand Australia what\\'s up HarleyBellamy Pioli what\\'s up guys thanks forjoining us some heavy Hammer Hittersfrom up in Australia as you know we talkabout the Duke Kahan moku and that uhthat big connection you know uh therewas a big connection with Duke andCecil yep um back in the day if Cecilnever said anything that giant Hawaiianmay have never gotten a shot you knowwhat I mean and that connection has gonethrough surfing as you know yeah coolyeah from a big Brotherhood and and andalso in that water there\\'s a watermanmovie It\\'s called Waterman the I lovedit I seen you on there you\\'re you\\'reyou\\'re starring in that you and a bunchof Legends Brian Keana narrated by MrMamo Jason Mamo good stuff you guys dida hell of a job on that and but it tellsthe story of of SES he and how you knowhe was an Olympic swimmer who wanted toserf to swim against Duke in in thisevent in the Olympics um but Duke missedthe the race and there was kind of amixup with the schedule or whatever umbut cesil petitioned and said no I\\'m notswimming unless Duke swims as well Iwant the best wants to swim against thebest gives me chicken skin thinkingabout it because there\\'s just somuch yeah yeah I mean unfortunately Ciluh um goes off in in to war in World WarI and ends up um dying in action soanother kind of tragic story butdefinitely you know have this likeyou\\'re saying Ezra this connectionbetween Australia and Hawaii and reallygoes back to Duan namoku who went toSurf Australia as he was in route to theOlympics MH and um so that\\'s kind of acool connection with Mak Doo let\\'sgo I always say the guy charges you knowDwayne Doo\\'s little brother all ourlittle brothers he\\'s not so little thisguy get action uh he\\'s from huo DOI waxand uh super stoked that he made

betterfront row seat than this oh no is soPricelesstickets beautiful shots from our dronesyou can see the mixture of sand and reefhere at pipe line you can see thosegrooves in thereef and the pipeline definitely has avery interesting bottom I use the wordInfamous but um mainly because that thatbottom is so treacherous there so manydifferent uh caves and grooves and Nookand and there is live Coral there\\'s alane of it by backdoor and some areas atpipeline so we got a Heat recap comingup herestarted off here Scotty Fong with thatlittle Bobble just getting his feet inthe wax he does get covered up and hegot alittle spit on his back mle Ho\\'s firstwave stalling here got the front hand infront of him avoids that shallow sectionthere on TheSandbar he\\'s lucky he went oh liveaction here whoa live action and we\\'llseewho thatwas as I see the board comeup looks like Mr Dino Miranda not takingany time spoke to him on the phone lastnight he\\'s ready to come getit and and you saw that looked like a aset a set that\\'s kind of larger thanwhat we saw earlier in the first heat sogood indication that the waves are ontherise he was also up in that thing youknow what I meantraveling excitingstuff I don\\'t know if he thank you Zmedia for that recap damaged his boardperhaps oh man looks like it\\'s got alittle more rocker than it should haveoh man I think there\\'s a buckle midthree foot he\\'s also on one of his surftechs that\\'s why growing up with theseguys I mean the amount oflongboards we would break is ridiculousthat\\'s why with all this new stuff toosurf Tech\\'s really strong you guys gotto check out Thunderbolt you\\'ll see someThunderbolts coming up in the next Heatssee the Japanese carbon and here we goDino Miranda that\\'s beautiful Isaiah hegets gutted but he also gets that Reverbthat shooked themoff I wonder if she\\'s broken cuz this islive right now it definitely looks likeit it\\'s got a bit more rocker than 9foot looks like uh got umtotally he\\'s even way up on thenose yeah that\\'s a lot of banana in thatshape yeah now now his board look 0 ohhe\\'s up he\\'s he\\'s on the Buckle so hecan paddle it ina well Dino I hope you flew over withtwo boards guy\\'s a very smart Surferthere is techniques to not break yourlong board butsometimes cannot help a certain waveespecially Pipeline and back door itdoesn\\'t it doesn\\'t matter and doesn\\'twearing a leash also play into it too ohhuge amounts that yank that Yank on yourtail always breaks it two to three feetfrom the tail and I\\'ll tell you what inlongboarding and you\\'re going to see himcoming up in new Earth Project KellySlater has a thing where you could gettotally licked but your board WillSurvive the white water comes up to youyou you wait for the white water to comeup oh here we go longa Perkins in thebarrel comes out oh on the S Bar we\\'llsee if his can survivethat yeah bongaPerkins riding his pinned out longboards Bunga Perkins surf boards finallymade his own board brand after all theseyears we\\'re all stoked from that was agreat wave for the start that was agreat wave for him probably I would saythe best scoring wave of the morning sofar here we go on the replay of thewater shot stalling holding on grabbingrail roll the window up a little bit guyhasn\\'t lost his touch still looks sogood we\\'ve emulated this guy since we\\'relittle kids growing up in whitei guy canride anything like you saidso I mean I\\'m 50 I think we\\'re the sameage so he\\'s out there grabbing rail youknow I wish my back was still as good asthat man right he\\'s also got a bad backto crouch low like that and grab a railand to be able to pump while you\\'re inthat position so yeah I never asked buthim and capona Nina you know I I don\\'tknow what it is between friends and badbacks but I feel like you can even passa bad back through a handshake you knowwhat I mean as much as you love yourbrother I mean we\\'re all kind of gettingthere oh awesome so some interviews onthe beach coming up right I\\'m going toget makao on the mic downthere and with mamea desota who just gotthirdplaceall right so we just heard reallyquickly that makamai got third place andI also heard that Maka ho will beadvancing in second placecongratulations brother and then firstplace Scotty was Scotty Fong who\\'sgetting barreled on the back door and uhwas the busiest Surfer in that last Heaty to each its own but when the hornblows everybody prepares different Ithink getting a wave under your beltright in the beginning on a rising swellis the w to go cuz then you can relaxand Shop but it\\'s got to be a completedBarrel ride and I do think and maybewe\\'ll get back to that interview but uhI\\'m guessing makami was a like late tohis heat because we didn\\'t see him inthe first half of the heat he dideventually get one wave uh butunfortunately one wave wasn\\'t enough weare on the second floor I wasn\\'tstalking him but man come on you guyscheck inearly me personally I I don\\'t likeracing for a heat and then you got toput in your fins thank goodness that youknow fins are different you just popthem in now a little biteasier look at this camaraderie here wegot the Aloha hand shaking going on inthe lineup yeah two former long boardworld champions in this heat din Mirandaand bongaPerkins they\\'re all sitting on bangarightnowall right we\\'re going to go back down toa live interview with makam dotoawesome we are here with makamai dootaand he just got third in the longboardpaddle how you feeling um I feel goodbom that I got third uh Missing it byone spot but uh yeah it\\'s a beautifulday got one barrel with 10minutes awesome and you had 10 minutesand you still got one barrel yeah I Ithought I was in the third heat but theypushed us up to the first seat and gotout there with 10 minutes left so gotoneawesome all right Mak s explain that hethought he was in the third heat onlyhad 10minute heat to surf supposed to be25 and uh was able to get one wave butunfortunately that one wave wasn\\'tenough but uh stoked to be here for sureand makamai has been in this event forseveral years now partof right um I know his familyinteresting has spent you know a lot oftheir Origins on the west side but alsoin Haula legacies yep haa grew up inlived in Haula as wellkahoku um attended kahoku high schooland um by the way the Red Raiders thefootball high school football statechamps again that was an incredible gameagainst Milani I don\\'t know you saw thatbutuh yeah I hear him joking on the radiothey should play uh and I I I I reallydig that but you know it it is funnyeverybody has their opinions some peoplesay no way but I was like hey man someof these guys are playing like youngstar athlete men already and theydeserve it congratulations Kahuku plentyroots in history with all of us on theNorthShore and islandwide as we got aset approaching we do look at thoselines out the back beautiful conditionswith those light offshore winds yeahhere brother Rock blowing up thebeach and oh we got some setsapproaching Bunga got one under his beltso people are going to reposition DinoMiranda just broke his surf Tech surfboard and I believe that\\'s him back outin the lineup so oh yeah quickly backout in the lineup don\\'t know if he wentduct tape that board or he would grabone second one I think that board wasbeyond duct tape I know as a surfer whenyou contradict trying to bring one boardor you know what I mean you need forthis performance right here you need tohave a backup and sometimes you needthree orfour because here at the back doorshootout in the main event of theshortboard these guys get to Surf likefour to five times you know what I mean25 30 minute Heats in a team format youknow with their brands or companies itcreates better camaraderie and it letsthe surfer relax but at the same timethese Surfers are also competing fortheir own right back door shootout titlewhich Benji bran got it last year andhere in the longboard division KeeganEdwards was the champion from last yearhe got uh two Cliff hangingbackdoor uh waves and mananalo was righton his butt real close with his pipewave and a nice backdoor traveler soright you got heat two of the longboardout in thelineup yeah we got Dino Miranda KeeganEdwards bonga Perkins kamakfrth uh ZackHoward yeah another West Side the freySeth Legacy oh yeah as their season willbe coming up in February make sure youjoin us at Makaha for Uncle Buffalo\\'sBig Board classic always got to say hito Uncle buff for he\\'s part of thiscommunity as well not justMakaha another hawaian water Patrol guyhokua Voyager firstlifeguard uh amazingstuff okay we\\'re going to look at thatbuckled Board of Dino Miranda as thiswas a scud miss this was a good one hewas close to Mak it out look at thattechnique where he pad St deeper to getbehind the curtain he almost had it itbut that foam ball caught up to him theboard you could see how the board peakedout the back and that uh you knowbecause the board is longer you know ithas more surface area to to break theboard and uh creates you know a lot lotmore tension in in in the board and soMH unfortunately broke it butfortunately he seemed to have a backupboard and right back out there out of alot of my longboard buddies Dino\\'s ofthe most barreled guys like you knowit\\'s funny like uh I would say him andDwayne doto they\\'ll be riding a wave andit\\'s not going to Barrel you know and itbarrels I mean it\\'s just they got thistouch and if you see Dina Miranda\\'sgiant World Champion feet and how girthyhis legs are the guy\\'s got some poweryou know what I mean his foot couldbreak his board if he\\'s not careful sometree oh so he\\'s going to be looking forthe back door but we got a paddler fromDeep oh oh oh oh little bit uh respectissue right there I mean that\\'scool little bit of a paddlebattle I believe that\\'s Keegan Edwardsin the blue shortsthere as this is the theoi back doorshootout no need jerseys ra we\\'re allhere to Surf this is like the onlyformat in the world like this where howwe we have these Surfers and we also paypay respects and homage to longboardingbody surfing and Elias so oh Keegan lastyear\\'schamp trying to get busy and I think youcan see that\\'s what happened little bittoo much pump off thebottom he realizes that there\\'s only 10minutes left on the clock and so he\\'sbeen starting to get busy uh caught onethat looked like it might have havegiven him the score but unfortunatelythat wave shut down you know what made adifference for him last year is he wassitting under everybody and they\\'d missit and you seen that back door with mewe were calling the heat he swung aroundinside Dino and I think that was hiswinning wave he got gutted he alsodidn\\'t come out of one but you do havescoring potential in these barrels of oftraveling so maybe a little bit of thatmemory from last year is contributing toa little bit of that paddle battle wesaw right hereyeah yo going left going right a helooked really bummed but that rightlooked like it was shutting down hefound this next one where it looked alittle more open yeah went a little toohigh yeah there was uh he did what hecould but there wasn\\'t much scoringpotential at all on thatwave they got plenty time left 852anything canhappenthink so far we you know this heat startoff with bonga getting an in and out Imean we also saw of course Dina Mirandagetting barreled but unfortunately notcoming out y breaking hissurfboard um but it looks like bongaPerkins is in the driver\\'s seat rightnow in this heat with only one wave uhhe\\'ll be looking to back up that onewave what a smart wave and and and whathe\\'s got to do now is just watch theclock even if you know a lot of myfriends nowadays you know when you getto our age we don\\'t even wear watchingour Heats you know we just go out therehave a good time but hopefully hewatches the clock because if he can geta second score he\\'s on his way to theback door shootout finals top twoadvance so congratulations in the firstheat Scotty Fong and MCO ho on to theback door shootout finals of 2024 I meanwhat a new year to get into the finalright off the bat yeah is our next Heatgoing out next Heat see Lanookano yeah you got uh Freddy ho hoi fromthe BigIsland I know Manalo channelers shouldbe in thisheat and that is Patrick fakuda Ibelieve in the backthere trying to make out if that\\'sDwayne doto because we all got also gotDwayne doto coming uplook at this one got a paddle herepretty deep looks like Keegan Edwardsgrabbingrail last year\\'s champ he knows backdoor and pipeline well this kid chargesHonolulu city and countylifeguard and grew up with this kid atsuch a youngage Keegan where\\'s your ThunderboltHarleyengelby oh here we go that is kamak conFrey Seth Makahaboy taking a paddle doing some swingkicks to get in oh can he slow down onice pocket ride by kamakan Frey Seth ohI believe that is uh Zack Howard excuseme Zack Howard riding his redB guy\\'s been surfing honolua Bay um noleash does pretty good at it too that\\'syou know as a surfer waves are pumpingit\\'s 8T you got a huge cliff in front ofyou here we goreplay stalling trying to get in thatBarrel but unfortunately he\\'s going toofast this guy\\'s uh definite BarrelHunter I think he\\'s probably thinking heshould have did a grab rail right offthe bat and then let go as he\\'s riding aheavier board this guy rideslogs and he\\'s very good at itbut yeah that no leash thing it\\'s it\\'sreally interesting because once you makeamistake oh hold swimming you\\'re swimmingand I and I and I\\'ve asked locals Iasked Dino Miranda the other dayspeaking of Dino here he goes scratchingthis and we got the water beautiful wavecome on let\\'s go oh Barrel monster andthat rut just took him and obliteratedhiminsideoh dino man he\\'s he came he\\'s notfoolingaround last year he he went shopping forsome waves and he he he missed one onthe inside here we go Keegan taking alook atpipeline oh going to go for the grabnice technique wave chandeliers over hishead a bit and oh right into the foamSandbar yeah you can see Keegan knowsthat is the clock is ticking and that umhe needs anotherone and I mean bonga Perkins still justsitting on one wave now that was thewave of the morning so far but yeahexcited for you bngo but 428 but but atin this point right now the way thewaves are moving he\\'s sitting reallygood but it would be real substantial ifhe got another wave under hisbelt and we are going full on they\\'regetting judged on their technical movesbut this event is about getting packedin a barrel and the way you get packedand these guys are innovating slowingdown in the tube how deep can you getcan you hold it anddisappear and can you get spat outbecause every wave comes in on the reefdifferent differentshape but all these specialists theyknow what they\\'re lookingfor so five minutes five minutesremaining gang you know Dino has beencharging in this heat and he\\'s beengetting the most barreled butunfortunately hasn\\'t been riding out ofthem that last wave we just saw where heI mean it\\'s really cool technique youwatch the way he he takes off on thewave he\\'s going left but he paddles intoit like he\\'s going right and that giveshim that extra time to stall to slowslow himself down um and so I mean greattechnique uh but unfortunately hasn\\'t Imean been able to come out of the barreland that\\'s in a surf contest like thisone where you\\'re uh Barrel riding Barrelriding contest it\\'s it\\'s that you knowthat compromise like okay I got to comeout of the barrel but I got to in get inthe barrel and how deep do I want to beto where I\\'m I\\'m putting it on the lineand so that\\'s a you know something thatthese Surfers these athletes have toreally make those kind of split-seconddecisions of all right how deep do Iwant to be and uh and yet still make itout there\\'s Uncle Lano okano and Mananalo with his uh yellow helmet I don\\'tknow if he borrowed mom\\'s board thisyear oh it was the helmet that wasyellow huh oh oh no last year he was ona yellow board yep he was on a yellowhelmet and a yellow rag um Rex godinasboard Megan\\'s dad all longboardCommunity amazing stuffbut you know as you\\'re talking aboutDino those were two real nice barrels soI\\'m wondering if he\\'s going to getawarded for somethingright as this contest is designed forthem to get Barrel in the best way butthey also have to adjust to theconditions out in this heat KeeganEdwards Bunga Perkins kamakani Frey SethZack Howard and Mr Dino Miranda alreadybroke the first Board of theevent man I I my oldest son so I havefive kids my oldest son prefers to ridea longboard so he\\'s um alongboarder but as aparent like it was expensive to say theleast of of trying to kept breaking themyou got a bunch of smoking secret spotsout that way especially you know a lotof these lighter weight high performancelong boards that aren\\'t cheap by the wayno and uhyou break one of them and uh it doesn\\'ttake much like I said because that umthat leverage that because the board islonger there\\'s a lot more opportunityfor the board to have that um you knowthat that flex and and it just does somedamage but uh but pipeline is probablyone of interestingly use the wordInfamous so infamous doesn\\'t mean veryfamous it\\'s famous in often times kindof a an a harsh way or like a negativeway and so pipeline is Infamous forbreaking surfboards and that it\\'ssomething that\\'s

shootout as we said we\\'re inlongboard surfing and brah you knowpipeline is already difficult enoughwith any piece of equipment but the morefoam or the more board you paddle outwith glass that that is a tight space tofit definitely and uh these guys arereally pushing the limits uh lot of sandstill there so you know they really gotto be selective on which wave to takeoff on that\\'s why you might think theyshould be going on certain ones thatthey don\\'t because it\\'s very easy tohave uh two boards in your hand yeahthat was one of the the uncles the OG\\'sgoing back door right there goofy footbackside you see thatturbulent you know Bubbles and then yousee the sand that you talked about Cliffkind of still sitting on the edge ofthat Reef making the exits a little bitdifficult

right herehe\\'s got the privilege of staying righthere looking at this wave every morningto see if it\\'s Prime conditions for himto enjoy the wonders of ehukai in thisarea yeah and you know like you said BRwearing the helmet that is um somethingthat has been more uh more widely usedthese days uh you know way back when itwas like you know TomCarroll uh leam mcnamer just a kind of aa few guys that would choose to wear thehelmet um as we watch I believe that\\'sPatrickmuda yeah that was a nice little piperide too made it out so you can see it\\'sstill kind of tricky like we saidearlier the swell is going to be fillingin throughout the day and uh it\\'s stilla lot of sand from that Eastnortheasterly swells we\\'ve had the lastcouple of weeks uh push the sand moretowards the pipe area so yeah the lastfew days it was it was pretty windy butit\\'s tapered off today still you knowour our number oneuh weather gauge is the coconut treesand uh right now the right now there thefronds are quite still yeah especiallywhen you don\\'t really see any coconutson them nowadaysunfortunately but with manalu wearingthe helmet and more Surfers opting forthat these days I mean you\\'ve seen a lotofinjuries here we go he\\'s pip there he isright thereoh that was a beautiful shot that was awave of the morning so far and I justwant to um we have a screen we\\'relooking at stuff but just for the recordnever turn your back on the ocean butwe\\'re doing that today yeah we\\'re doingwe are sitting with our back to theocean so that you folks can see that itdoes feel a little uh unsafe and awkwardat first to get used to when you\\'reocean guys like us here on the replayyeah that\\'s how to do it rightthere you know Dismount so you talkabout the helmets and stuff like thatand uh you know I think it\\'s a great uhinvention and a great idea to wear itespecially out here yeah with the reefand the the shallowness and just thedangers that um come with surfing thisarea and I mean a lot of areas out onthe North Shore as well um a lot offolks have been getting injured herethere\\'s some head injuries we\\'ve beencoming across so pretty pretty good ideato have one on if you\\'re going to servequite for sure yeah speaking of uhresponding Cliff not only has uh a lotof Hawaiian water Patrol time but alsois stationed right down the street hereuh for the Honolulu fire department atSunset Beach so serving the community uhvery well and with a lot of commitmentwe appreciate that and but if there\\'sanyone that can speak with experience ofseeing some gnarly injuries uh brotherCliff has seen a lot and um especiallyout here you know yeah this this thisone of the longer coastlines withbeautiful beaches and and a lot of niceouter Reef breaks and things like thatso there\\'s always a a chance for injuryespecially with uh the enjoyments ofSurfing and a lot of people want to getout there and enjoy the waves but um italso presents its fair share of dangersand stuff so we do see a lot of stuff uhHawaiian water Patrol fortunately I wasable to work with them for a long timeand um Uncle Terry and Brian kolina andall the boys that work there I can godown a list of names that especially theones we do have now you know yeah um alot of the boys from a car coming inclutch yeah and uh no there\\'s lots ofexperience so if you\\'ve uh had a chanceto make it down to the beach see some ofthe

yeah and you got some of thegreatest who I didn\\'t see their name inthe competition but they did pave theway you know you got Thea kalas and thekol mcge that would be out here bombingpipeline 10 12 feet um on a standup solike with a shortboard it\\'s hard enoughmaking it out when it\\'s that big andthose guys paddle those things out andactually take off and had times whenthey actually made it out of the barrela lot more than they didn\\'t and it\\'spretty impressive one of the one of themost impressive and you said youmentioned the the original one of thepioneers of standup paddle at pipe IAKama yeah I remember being out there onmy short port and just watching him dropinto these bombs and just AR Soul Archit backside make it look natural holdinghis paddle up little paddle roof Tickleryeah inside the barrel making it look sonatural and easy and it was bombing andlike you said it is like so difficultvery difficult make it look easy likethat difficult to make it out when it\\'sflat yeah amazing display of talent soshout out to brother yeah brother up in representing Big Island uphav Island now that was a um late dropdrop could be um possibly checking onhim to see that was you know right inthat spot where kind of like turtle saidon North Shore when the wave breaks heredon\\'t be there you\\'re going to H youthat\\'s where he was he was right thereyeah especially in this spot um not somuch right now it\\'s this is where itgets even more dangerous too and it\\'snot as big right cuz uh means it\\'s a lotmore shallow but um yeah he\\'s up he\\'sgood that\\'s the main thing yeah it\\'sit\\'s breaking further in so it\\'s over alittle bit shallower Reef when it\\'sbigger it\\'s breaking further out so youget you know a little bit more water butand your guard is down a little bit onsome of these days as you watch him justright there gets a too steep ra actionmention that you you know 9 foot boardtrying to fit in the tight curve of thewave the physics just aren\\'t in yourfavor it\\'s not in your favor at all butit does take a a talent and like wementioned is uh the waveselection uh you know not every wavethat rolls through there is the oneyou\\'re going to want to right takeadvantage of especially when it\\'s uhyou\\'re on a longboard kind of don\\'t haveI don\\'t have that type of Arsenal andquiver to be snapping boards at pipe ona you know what I mean so yeah selectionall that surface area the board can bemuch morevulnerable as the Drone shotlooking into the beach from the lineupsee the water shimmering and smooth atthe moment it is still uh just about9:20 Hawaiian Standard Time as we watchUncle Lance okano getting there andtrying to get to that get around thecorner but he\\'s like oh bro my hips nolike do what I used to do before yeahthe guys from Ocean paddler TV I mean Igot to give them props I mean this isamazing footage yes they got cameraseverywhere you can see this back doorwave okay that\\'s Freddy hu Freddy Htrying to make it out of the back doorand it just clamps him it\\'s a littletricky one but uh go bigger go home hewent packed that one uh wasn\\'t able tomake it out yeah courageous effortpretty good wave selection uh on thetakeoffand then was racing down the line thatwave kind of outran him a little bit buthere you go check out the drop realsmooth casual nicestyle and uh no doggy door really tosneak out of on that one yeah that was aback door slamming shot when you have ayou have a 10- foot dog to try and sneakout of the doggy dooryeah he\\'s up he\\'s good that\\'s the mainthingright but yeah I was talking about thefoot AG they even got drone shots andthey have what they\\'re going to try thisyear they were saying is uh they got aGoPro on a helmet we\\'re trying to lookfor a a rider that would be interestedin a a volunteer a volunteer if you\\'dlike to wear that helmet and try andgive them the opportunity to show therest of the world a shot from inside abarrel that\\'d be pretty killer yeah livefrom the GoPro helmet that would be uhan epic shot we saw that sick camerashot from the ski of balo\\'s backsideBarrel that was just pure gold far as asuh production goes so ocean paddler TVAlex and the crew big Mahalo forstepping up this year and uh puttingtogether a first class broadcastexperience and Hawaiian water Patrol inthe foreground right there and you seetwo skis out there there\\'s our cameramanthere\\'s a cameraman and and how is itoperating the ski with a camera guy Imean that\\'s a whole anotherit\\'s a whole another Dynamic cuz whatyou\\'re normally used to is yourself asan operator and the person you have onthe back normally the Grabber rightyou\\'re kind of working as one we havejust Jay looking to take offhere nice little head tuck there allright but yeah so uh you know you have adynamics of having a grabber on the backwho knows what you\\'re expecting andstuff so it\\'s a little easier when youhave a cameraman he\\'s trying to fulfillhis job right capture the shot you\\'retrying to open it up to put him in thebest position for it and uh he\\'s not soused to being on a ski a lot of timesand so that\\'s the part where it getskind oftricky and uh is that Uncle Jay tansleyJay tansley on the little headdip get kind the Inside Out pocketflapper I like that style pocket HotPocket just for short ofspeed that\\'s the that\\'s the wind flagyeah the wind sock check the directionoh here we go manalu packing another oneis he going to make it out oh no Ithought maybe hemight that was a niceone yeah so those are the type of wavesyou know I think it\\'s a it\\'s kind of theline you\\'re looking for as a surferyou\\'re trying to get a little higherpick your right line so you can make itout um that\\'s the trick about surfingthis spot and as you knowRocky uh you probably never in your lifebe able to Surf pipe with a handful ofother guys out yeah it it\\'s um it\\'s kindof it\\'s a different perspective you knowwhen um the heat is coming to an end butI got to say I like Mana nalu\\'s chancesof advancement that one barrel was Wselection yeah amazing and uh we\\'ll talkmore about it um as uh we change overthe Heats so it\\'ll be uh standup paddleboardingcoming upnext standup paddle boarding and this iswhat we were talking about earlier thisis going to make for some really good uhsurfing especially standup surfing hereat pipe um our heat w we got a couple ofguys in there uh that really do send itand they do push the limits uh guys likemorrus uh rigs Napoleon and tootu whosewife justwon yeah the master y his wife MoanaJones W so we\\'ll get a chance to seemoana\\'s husband T tootu Wong work hismagic here atpipe see the helmet on settingthemselves up for Success already whatthe board that board is submersible he\\'ssinking it that\\'s so yeah crazy how someof the guys have scaled down theirequipment to a size that\\'s moremaneuverable and uh as we get ready forHeat number one of Stan Up pow boardingwe\\'re going to look back at what we justsaw and check out a recap of heat numberthree long boarding and uh we saw Freddyhoie Hoy getting some nice little uhpipe Barrel tube time right there butthis was the wave of the manalu Manaloright here oh my gosh just so well doneshow how it is and one of our youngerguys showing a lot of experience andTechnical skill with the ability to getin and out of that Barreland then J tansley tley here cruisinghim little head dip under the curtainwith the wind sockyeah so that was uh he number three oflongboard and it looked like to me itwould be so the top two guys go to thefinal right so far we got Scotty Fongand Maka ho and he won it I think bongauh was in the mix for Heat number twoyeah and um in that last Heat I gottasaymanalu and Freddy Hui Freddy hu I wouldsay have great chances have greatchances rides yeah and these are 25minute Heats right now and then thefinals will go into be 30 so give them alittle bit more time to dial in theirwave selection and their uh Maneuversand stuff like that so it\\'s Eddie Garciarigs Napoleon Mo freedus tou WongSebastianGomez and you might bewondering how do you tell who\\'s who wellwe\\'re just uh going on style stancelogos on the board yeahbecause as we said on the beach mic youknow thehoie traditionally has been known to uhnot always do things like by the book orbecause everybody else says you got todo them like this making our own rulesmaking our own rules yeah has been quitea you know steadfasttradition and so this this event wedon\\'t have jerseys because we don\\'t haveto no need yeah we don\\'t need no no needdon\\'t plan our day and yeah it gives uhour Surfers a chance to choose if theywant to just go skin you know get somesun get some vitamin D yeah show off theyou know the muscl Shir shirts and skinsgrowing up on what TV we on and um orthey can wear their sponsor logo to getsome uh beautiful photos that\\'s anotherum plus kind of byproduct of having anevent like this you get no crowd in thelineup yeah like nice empty waves nophoto bombers no photo bombs and thenyou get some beautiful opportunity toget shots for your sponsor do some workcuz you know pro surfing It\\'s a GrindIt\\'s a Grind it\\'s not like it\\'s not likethe normal pro pro uh Pro Sports um youcan be getting product and be consideredyou know Pro yeah and not really gettingthe money t that it\\'s needed to surviveespecially here in Hawaii you know it\\'sso expensive and stuff like everybodyelse is feeling it as well but yeah youthink of pro surfing and it\\'s like KellySlater yeah you know Gabriel Medina AndyIrons you know the kind they\\'re they\\'remaking you know well into uh goodcomfortable money very comfortable moneyand uh supporting 1% yeah but there\\'s awhole Litany of aspiring or lower levelPro Surfers that have to grind it out aswe watch oh that back door uh back doorwave we\\'ll try and get get you somenames there butuh we can warm up into the names once wesee a few is that tootu might be tou onthe back door a rogue logo the Roguepaddleboard yeah so uh sponsorship and stufflike that uh very creative though thekids nowadays uh this next Generationcreating YouTube channels and thingslike that they\\'re making instead ofwaiting for somebody to give them offersthey\\'re going travel the world surf makea YouTube channel and make a decent wagedoing that so that\\'s pretty coolfollowing their dreamsyeah you know um the the Advent and theuh introduction of all of the you knowlike the GoPro camera you can shootyourself and then being able to comeback in and edit it so the kids got allkinds of skills these days as we seesome skill getting in the barrel justgetting a little sucked over on that onecaught that outside edge it\\'s a trickytricky wave to maneuver um especiallywhen it\\'s this size but on the rise yeahso hopefully you see some more actionsee all the Surfline forecast earliercalling for an increase in the swellthey brought is down to his pockets inwater right there ping asubmersible the Drone getting a shot ofthe lineup so yeah I was saying earlierlike you know when you surf pipe on aregular day there\\'s going to be 50 60people yeah kind of tightly packed uhyou got back door the right-hander pipethe left and if it\\'s a day where bothare working there\\'s going to be somecrossups and some you know going thisway that way yeah kind of a circus kindof a circus but there are a lot of timeswhen I would be out there and you usecertain areas of the lineup like okaythat\\'s that\\'s where Tomo\\'s sitting yeahso that\\'s where waita is sitting that\\'swhere Randall is sitting that\\'s where uhyou Uncle Derek is sitting some prettyheavy position yourself you know kind ofbased on where they\\'re at yeah and thenyou go out there for a heat and nobody\\'sout there you get a little bit lost uhwhen when you first experience thatbecause you\\'re so used to seeing tons ofheads in the water and those particularguys that you\\'re queuing off of arenormally in the spots but yeah and thenyou get out there when it\\'s empty andit\\'s like whoa okay where am I where\\'smy lineup exctly your normal lineupisn\\'t really on the board so you\\'reusing you know cracks in the reef you\\'reusing houses up on the on the beach hereeven the mountains and things behind upthere and then the people that are inthe water there\\'s a you know for meanyway you want to be in the best spotyou can be yeah uh to to be able to pickoff one of those bombs on a day whenit\\'s you know it\\'s good it\\'s crowdedtons of cameras on the beach cameras inthe water you know I\\'ve got a fewsponsors like we said you know you\\'retrying to get some shots trying to likeput some food on the table exactly youknow tank more than Simon and hot dogsso you know I wanted to go haliva Joe\\'sthat day so you know I had to get thebiggest best wave and get the shot getthe shot and theShaka but uh yeah definitely a trickyspot to navigate and uh the dangers thatit come with it if you\\'re not in theright spot yeah and you\\'re not ping likeyour life depends on it cuz it does yeahthere a strong possibility you can getvery very hurt here at pipe it\\'s a verydangerous wave we\\'ve lost loved ones andfriends here we\\'ve watched Friends gethurt we\\'ve brought some back to life Imean the list goes on and on you knowyeah even just most recently mostrecently Joel chanka yeah uh we\\'rehoping that he\\'s in recovery mode he\\'sscheduled to be surfing here you know innext month for the later thismonthuhso yeah we just got word that we do haveuh

not super deep andif they got in there deep it was uheither close out or couldn\\'t make it outbut Manalo was one of the ones that wasable to get deep and then also come outnice and clean too right in the openface what you\\'re striving for every timeyou padle out to this break you want tomake it out yeah first thing you want todo is make it out make it out to theline the lineup and then you want tomake it out of the barrel days there\\'sdays when that is not easy as we looknoan carola on the ski over here one ofthe bestwatermenuh here in Hawaii yeah he\\'s a beastWaterman amongwatermen and so

a little replayof a back door wave we saw just a momentago couple of replays we\\'re goingthrough this is Mofreist and uh another Mo I like that oneMo I like that uh yeah that paddle tucktechnique very that\\'s pretty cool howyou can see some of the guys utilize thepaddle as well right some of them use itto help turnyeah and stuff of that nature so it\\'sadding a little degree of difficultywith having something in your hands likethat and uh yeah and I feel like uhthat\\'s a lot of the reason there hasbeen a lot of kite and wind Surfers thathave converted to uh standup paddlesurfing because they are used to havingthat crossbar and so you\\'ve seen guyslike uh K de boits come from the kitesurfing kyeni and transition be veryskilled at handling um and surfing withsomething in your hand that\\'s you knowregular conventional short board andlong boarding your hands free so rightyou got a little more uh freedom to getyour hands you know for style but whenyou got to incorporate holding a paddlethatisg forsure just couple of guys just sittingthere talking story normally not thecase here at pipe everybody\\'s jockingfor position so this is one of theBeauties about this event uh you

that\\'sa replay oh that was just getting alittle too high line there then the thebottom dropped out from under them yeahit\\'s like the the trap door the trapdoor walking around in the Attic oopspush the reset button yeah you\\'re in theAttic next thing you know you\\'re on thediningtable the technique of getting throughwaves with standup paddle boardequipment isgot a couple different kind oftechniques you saw the you saw the ruggetting pulled out from under I likethat one you know the the kickboardkickboard techque front yeah rightlittle pipe action not not really thepipe that we\\'re normally seeing but uhthere\\'s a lot of sand that still has tomove and everything yet but there ispotential out there if you find a gemyeah from that off the uh nice and crispyeah quality definitely definitely soyou know watching Mo on the backand uhcarving at pipeline yeah reminds me ofone of our first uh backdoor shootoutwinners Johnny Boy Gomes back in the daythe Masters at and smashing when he wasgoing backside and unloading some ofthose under the lip snaps never ski legdayright so they\\'re padding for this onelook like a little nugget a littlerunner backdoor stalling a little that could beedarnice little back door wave we didn\\'tquite get to see the pipe I\\'m sure we\\'llsee the replay but uh yeah splitting thepeak another back door little tricky onebut uh that Dronefootage another back door so they gotsome wave action coming through now likea little wave machine M pumping down theline back doordoes not make it out he tried catch somespeed for that the wave is really fastuh but yeah it\\'s not just barrels todayyou know like you said little off thetoop floaters and things like that yougot to get creative to get your pointstoday forsure maybe it\\'ll change as a swell Fs inyou know and the paddle back outtechnique you see the hand paddlingthere formolus uh and I even saw him earlier flyhis paddleahead like 20 yards yeah like throughover the wave and then he paddled andwent through it on the laying prone yeahand then we saw the other techniquewhere you fall on your back and kick theboard forward over the wave so a coupledifferent ways of getting back outthere\\'s a nice little stall right thereand uh the shampoo shower conditionerbubble bat sprinkle onceagain Head and Shouldersthat replay on the pipe replay onmorrus\\' back door little pump

ran by theHawaiian surfing Club 49e history unlikeno other and you know thathistory yeah so yeah the hoie uh1976 those are really interesting yearsin Hawaii the mid70s because in the midst of this whatwhat we call often times historians willcall the Hawaiian Renaissance so in the1970s in Hawaii there\\'s a real shiftthat\\'s taking place with like the senseof Hawaiian identity um you know inyears prior a lot of Hawaiianculture you know kind of struggled to umto survive in many ways um but we saw inthe 70s and into the 80s of course thisResurgence for example Haw language uhwe see a lot of resurgence in Hawlanguage where it\\'s it U previous yearsit was was not allowed to be taught inin elementary schools or in in inschools um in the 70s they shift to tomake that difference so that ha languageis revitalized through Hawaiianimmersion programs which today is verystrong in fact we have in the heat herepoai H um his his kids and my kids go tothe same schoola Hawaiian languageimmersion program beautiful but the 70swere all about that um and and surfingis part of that tradition and and uh ofof Hawaiian culture and revitalizationso the who is a part ofthat we\\'re

watching Mo freedus earlierit\\'s like he\\'s standing on like a 70 youknow sunk in takes a lot of leg strengthbalance a lot ofcore and a lot of core values in standuppaddling heel toe Edge if you ever havea sore foot and you go out and stand uppaddle your feet are going to be waymore sore after that man you\\'re carryingyour weight you\\'re leaning absorbingright yeah all the pretty sure this isBernard I don\\'t think Zayn is uh orum yeah that that Bernard going rightand split Peak there oh Bernard okay andBernard is looking to get a six-pointride to get into the advancing seat wegot PA May and Zayn so far who are I\\'mnot familiar with Bernard but he\\'s got anice smooth style really really yeahwelcome to the back door shootoutBernard and you know this event out ofall the events you know got to getinvited but the way the and huo healoyou know it\\'s always been a old hwanstory our athletes from down hereislandwide don\\'t get in certain eventsand this one pays homage to the pipeSpecialists even guys from out of townthat have been here and put in theirtime with so much respect andamazingness and with aloha right you cansee on the screen up next our longboardfinal coming up next here we have ZaySwitzer grabbing rail going back doorcan he get in that bar he gets brieflycoveredup oh beautiful backside carve into anice Whitewater rebound and he snappedit off like a shortboard that wasawesome zaye swies are changing it uploses there he is behind you bro oh andthen he\\'s going to have to oh not too Bdad sometimes you just get worked inthere look at that technique big dogslowing down dragging his thigh in thewater he\\'s also holding his paddle as hewas in the barrel instead of holding itwith his Rail and then he switched to dothat massive cut back to Whitewaterrebound wow you got steezed out on thatone he\\'s going to negotiate some whitewater cuz these guys are riding realshort standup boards let me tell you uha regular human wouldn\\'t be able tostand on it it would sink you got tokeep the thing constantly movingso yeah that is amazing the how smallthese boards I remember when you knowstand up pedal first started they\\'revery big boards very long and now outhere at pipeline they\\'re riding reallyshort boards here wego oh my goodness wow switches stanceand he switches stance now he\\'s goofyfoot okay is that the same guy or whatBernard switching it uplike burn geredor yeah so one of the best wind Surfersin the world and switching stance likeRusty kelana that was awesome had no youcould couldn\\'t even tell that he wasn\\'tnatural goofy watch this replay stallsWows in completelygone that is going to change thingscomes out with some spit yeah ohbeautiful stance at the end feettogetherconfident Pai here we go he\\'s going tothread the needle good technique withthe paddle slowed down did all he coulddo right Isaiah on that one so he\\'sgoing to capitalize and get anotherpretty good second score this should beinteresting because all three of ourcompetitors right now are going to bereally close in as far as scores areconcerned currently I\\'m excited to seeBernard that was a clean in and out burnuh rigard I mean I didn\\'t realize I meanhe is one of the best uh wi Surfers outthere Maui and bringing his uh you knowhis skill to stand up paddle today atthe back door shootout showing a lot ofVersatility a replay of Pai dragging thepaddle gets quickly covered up that SARcloseout section he has to straightenout to avoid that closeoutso we have P my Zayn and burn who arevery close in in their um really closeit\\'s going to come down to a wave at 252remaining and from what I\\'m seeing wehave a a score for him at a 5.33 forthat Barrel that uh rodiger got so he\\'sright there in the mix but the thescores are so close because has beenalso getting some great rides and Payaas well so they\\'re all sitting veryclose to each other just um fractions ofa point off our judging panels pickingit apart Barton Lynch Flynn Novak lovehodell jelent tail you put these guys injerseys you know what I mean they\\'redangerous still Joel s tail man he couldgo out to back door and win thething so so pay looks like he\\'s in thelead with an 8.5 Zayn Switzer with a717 and riger with a seven so all allriger needs now is a3.18 to move into that top two positionyeah so they definitely have to realizethat they have 150 as all three athletesare standing up at least they\\'re notrubbing elbows you know what I meanpaddle check paddlecheck they are significantspread out as you can see from the oceanpaddler TV drone and and uh doesn\\'t looklike there\\'s any Pacific ribs coming infor this last minute but you never knowaium pipe wave could change it at thispoint because they are so close andlooks like zann is camping right on topof riger knowing oh he\\'s an athlete he\\'sthe two-time defending champion of thisevent so he\\'s going to want to make thefinal so for to solidify the final oh hejust fell off he\\'s like let\\'s just laydownnow and rodar was smart to sit on theinside cuz all he needs is a3.17 these guys have such goodsportsmanship even though they have thatgnarly competitive bone look at themthey\\'re just talking story you don\\'treally see that that much well it lookslike our scores have updated I didn\\'trealize there were some changes to thescores or that it was still updating yepstill up dating all right but it seemsthat but I feel that you see that wavewasn\\'t totally updated that was a 683 Ikind of felt that that wave was up thereit was going into the excellent rangeand that puts Mr riger Right up as uhfirst time me getting to know him andwatching him surf an amazing Maui boyand you know they\\'re not just hearinghe\\'s one of the best wind Surfers in theworld once you know about that about himthat\\'s not all he does yeah growing uparound Rush Randall and then that lookedlike the updated scores that Bernard didmake it up to the top him and po Mayalooks like

they\\'re staying right thereoverlooking pipe I mean it\\'s all aboutreps reps yeah putting in the timeputting the time in on the water at thisbreak it\\'s always different you knowevery day is not the same today\\'s alittle tricky this morning especiallywith waiting for the swell to move in uhwave selection like we talked aboutearlier and stuff like that um kind ofcame in clutch for him yeah I I uh Ilike your you know pretty clean cutCliff you know looking professional yeahI got the this is um you guys saw aglimpse of Wild Bill of what I got goingon back here it\\'s uh I it\\'s beyond amullet it\\'s a Malo it\\'s a Malo theFlyingFish and um you know my my uh phrase hasbeen I got you got to farm it where itgrows yeah yeah know and you\\'re far youlittle little on top is kind of hard youknow no more that much seeds but in theback ho a buger is Tick yeah yeah Ican\\'t complain I can\\'t that\\'s what we\\'reuh we\\'re working with you see the paddleboarders getting in their positionssweeping what some would say is sweepingthe sidewalk outthere uh yeah they\\'re they\\'re gettinginto position they\\'re trying to setthemselves up for Success here in the uhstandup paddledivision finals see the beautiful colorsin the reef right there from the Droneshot you know it\\'s a little bit you knownot overcast but it\\'s not like brightand sunny you can see the kind of theflat lighting from the cloud cover whichmakes it a little more comfortable onthe beach it\\'s not blazing hot yeah andum definitely uh getting some beautifulfootage with that drone up above andthen we\\'ve got the camera that\\'s on thejet ski getting those nice water shotsright in inside the barrel definitelyAlex and the crew for uh o ocean patterTV spectacular job we got Pai oh Paipacking one at pipe oo Pai Hanother Northshore native Haw Watermanand uh also member of the Hawaiian waterPatrol has a lot of experience with thiswave and this uh side of the island aswell so he\\'s uh trying to find that gemneeded to hopefully do a good uh showinghere in the final yeah look at thatstyle that\\'s a beautiful shot rightthere packed it right there I just gotaway from him a littlebit so that back door wave was SebastianGomez here\\'s live action Mo frus niceone Mo packing the back door on that onegive me some Mo give me someMo nice so you can kind of see how thewaves are different if you\\'ve beenwatching uh those last two waves rightthere uh one pipe wave got away from pomy Mo was able to pack that back doorand make it out so wave selection is keyhere clutch yeah see seems like some ofthe the midsize waves have been the onesthat have been a little more open yeahthe big sets little bit closing out youknow um not offering the the nice openexit opportunity so you see Mo freedusas you said Cliff wave selection movingin on the inside a little bit yeah andpicks off one that allows him to make itthrough yeahdefinitely he he had a little whoopedDoo too there is thought that was alittle backwash kind of kind of a dealhe had to deal with but yeah well wellridden wave on the back door there\\'sthat shallow section on the inside wherethe wave or the water kind of peels offyeah and then starts to head back out tothe lineup and that you\\'ll see uh as theSurfers take off or they riding thelittle bumps yeah and the wave kind offlexyeah definitely not only you have tomake the drop you got to navigate thosea couple of times tooso these guys are looking to see wherethe spotis um you know pipe isn\\'t a normalstandup paddle wave right you don\\'treally see guys stand up pading it sothey don\\'t recommend it either yeahdefinitely not the spot for for it butthese guys are some of the best thatstand uppaddling in the world and so there\\'sthat backwash too backwash uh tootunavigated very well right there and herewe got The Sandbar special right there Ithink that\\'s I think that\\'s badrigger he was uh able to go goofy footand regular foot swapping it up a littlebit kind of like uncle Ross K Makatalking about him being banal yeah B andbut Prett amazing yeah exactly yeahswitch stance and whatnot hey when youcan always go front side yeah it\\'s apretty good skill yeah andthen switch him up toBackside no no takers on that one nicedrone shot of the Dynamics ofpositioning for the wave Zay schwitzerzay\\'s looking like he\\'s going acrosslooking thater looks like he\\'scommitting to this one righthere yeah so we\\'ve got a tahan to Wongwe got this guy from bowi Zay schwitzerand just afast breaking wave that doesn\\'t give himtoo muchopportunity watch how Zayn goes throughthat wave that\\'s that\\'s one of the waythrough one of the ways to get throughit but you see everything\\'s right thereby him you knowso I probably would have taken it on thehead but uhyeah that\\'s one way to get through itkick the board through and then you\\'rejust dealing with the paddle I I likelike that maneuver I call it the youknow pull the rug out from under yourmaneuver it\\'s like somebody\\'s likeyou\\'re standing on a area rug andsomebody just Yanks it right from underyour feet and you send it send it rightthrough thelip I want to say

clothing way back inthe day vintage some vintage clothingyeah dropp in some uh some OG yeah someOG turned into allos but that\\'s a wholeanothershow so here we go guys is getting readyto take this one it looks like it\\'s apotential is that P my no that\\'s banedban little Maui boy soable to go front side see the leash onthe front foot he is a regular footSurfer by trade but has been working onhis St skillsyeah oh is that somebody deep a backdoor potential oh that\\'s was looking atthe left he was super deep he was superdeep so like we were talking aboutearlier not the normal standup paddlewave but these guys are making the bestof it um very dangerous you know we didhave uh hopefully kyen is all right butwe we did have an injury already in theeventyeah so we got a report that there was ahead injury yeah for KY Lenny uh I thinkhe was wearing a helmet and it gotripped off his head and then he stillgot injured and then um Hawaiian waterPatrol did uh enlist the um assistanceof EMS em so we heard the ambulancearrive for uh for kyeni and we\\'ll hopethat he\\'s okay enough to keep competingin the shortboard division so he wasgoing to paddle out for the standuppaddle uh because he was in bothdivisions but it is a single divisiononly per entrance and so he made theeasy choice of wanting to stay in theshort board division yeah you know inStand paddle you might surf twicethere\\'s some calw being enjoyed on thebeach right there by some of our crowthat is they\\'re makingright yeah little crunchy with someextra sand sand pebbles but sandgrains lots of flavorthough so these guys are going for itsomebody\\'s packing back door back oh Bunder the lip wow oh he\\'s going to Ithought for sure he\\'d be able to doggydoor that thing but it was so close yousee how fast that wave gets like he hadsome speed but just depends ontopography that drop was just thereright under the lip as late as you canget right there just is in the barrelfrom the takeoffyeah and right there it just runs youknow pull my Ops out of thatone they did uh split Peak on that lastone you get a lot of that when the wavesare uh pretty much this size and biggeryou\\'ll get a sneaker through maybe ifyou split it you don\\'t normally see thesplit Peak but uh it has to be uh theperfect start in a sense yeah once itgets above a certain size it kind ofshifts to just more of pipeline but thismid-range uh is more conducive to havingthe both Peaks being available both waysbothdirections and on the backand mobeautiful shot oh get pitched that\\'skind of like a perfect Shot For YouFolks at home to get to see exactly whatgoes down in that Barrel you know yougot to navigate a lot of different uhthings there in the wave and on the wavejust like that little dig rail it\\'s justso hard to maneuver these boardscomparative to the size of the wave aswell and the textures and all that goodstuff that they got tonavigate yeah when you look into thebarrel and watch a guy like you know mofreedus who\\'s amazingly talented yeahand this wave can make the most talentedperson look like a total C right and uhit it definitely uh exposes a lot of thehuman vulnerability yeah of uh supplyingcook since ever since right yeah I meanpipeline still rules there\\'s Pai lookingnice and comfy for themoment it hits that sandbar and jumpsoff but that was a just a crazy dropcouple of replays you can see that Wjust run on him mannot much you could have done there andthen Mo Mo\\'s little get a little highline and then gets totallypitched so just about a minute remainingsee the time on the upper left there forthis standup paddle final padle finalshere to might be this one up maybedoesn\\'t look like much in thehorizon just over aminute well I\\'ve seen quite a few goodrides it\\'ll be hard to say uh you knowthe last Heat it was pretty definitivethat mananalo got the best waves uh eventhough there were some late charges inthe heat from Dina Miranda and frombonga Perkins a little different in thisheat but this heat is kind of still inmy opinion is anybody\\'s gameon the pipe another split Peak possiblyoh Pai nice ride bro nice positioningthere yeah that was well nicepositioning niceride and of the heat it\\'s a decentdecent wave for him forsure and that was uh Zan schwierschwizer at the back door we\\'ll see uhwhat he was able to do we\\'ve got acouple different angles to work withfrom ourgreat

ourbody surf final so just a one Heat finala chance for these you know normallywhen you\\'re body surfing pipe you got tonavigate between the Surfers and theother body boarders and so can be quitetricky to get a good wave when you gotto compete with all those other boardRiders but now we give these guys achance to have pipe to thems and uh whatan opportunity yeah definitely anopportunity and like you said Rocky uhit\\'s extremely hard when there you addSurfers into this mix to even get a wavelet alone you know these guys are orguys Ang gals I should say are heretoday being able to just have free rangeof that that lineup which normally isn\\'tthe case when there\\'s Surfers in the mixfor sure yeah and I mean you and I bothhave uh spent a lot of time in the waterum you know

around our Island youknow from point panics to sandies youname it makapuu you know they\\'re outthere enjoying the ocean just by whatyou see here surfing with their usingtheir just their body you know it\\'spretty amazing to see how long the ridescan actuallybe a nice little long ridetherehere we go little replay of a nicetechnique you saw the the front the youknow the the lead hand kind of holdingthe line and then the little elbowaction from the back a Rudder A littleRudder and uh doing some steering yeahand kind of you know the whole key withbody surfing is you want to haveyourself you know stick into the waveyou don\\'t want to try to get airborneyou don\\'t want to you know slide downyou want to hold that line you know it\\'syou\\'re just dealing with so much lessspeed because you\\'re not on a board andum you end up you know riding in thepocket of the wave so much more whenyou\\'re body surfing so making it outahead of the of the pocket is verytricky very tricky verytricky uhso right here is our body surfing eventand uh this is the final there\\'s athere\\'s a wah right there she\\'s gettingher action in here at the pipeline aswell um we\\'re on we\\'re standing by forwhatever else would come our way for theevent after this but we\\'re getting someaction here with the body surfing that\\'sprettykiller but you can see this event Ithink it\\'s as you can see men and womensurfing together that I mean bodysurfing together you know it\\'s prettykiller yeah I like the co-ed format yeahand we do have uh or we don\\'t have Ishould say some of the Legends wenormally would see like Mark Cunninghamand those guys that paved away thatusually be surfing pretty good siiz pipeactually you\\'ve seen him out here bigwaves and they go long rides and put onclinics but uh nonetheless in still feelpretty amazing to watch these guys andGS surf with just theirbodies really hard to get in on thewave not easy todo to kind of get yourself down the waveand I mean you have to be obviously sucha strong swimmeryeah and you know a lot of ourlifeguards kind of opt for the bodysurfing as a form of training keepingyourself in shape uh and good swimmingshape so uh we\\'ve seen like youmentioned Mark Cunningham formerlifeguard and committed to the bodysurfing committed to the body surfingvery committed forsure just about 13 40 left in the bodysurfing heat so uh we\\'re hoping thatsome we see some sets comethrough so these guys in gals can uhhave opportunity to uh showcase theirability on a little bit bigger rise likethese waves are still decent size reallyfun for not having to do it Surfers inthe lineup for sure yeah we\\'re still umyou know waiting for the fullpotential of that swell that isforecasted to build throughout the dayuh we\\'ve seen some of the Waves come inthat could have you know could be aforerunners or indicators of it but wehaven\\'t seen it really come up you knowto size where you know it would be a a asure thing that short boarding would beon we\\'re kind of still on standby to seeif that is going to be happening we\\'llkeep you updated as uh the dayprogresses and this heat goes through umI want to say Mahalo to mahina mahinaChillingworth doing all of theorganizing and um directing for thisevent definitely not an easy task forsure it is a a lot going on forsure and especespecially especially to make the calluh what we\\'re going to do next you knowthey they wantto so they kind of want to um they theykind of wantan to you want to run theshort board too but you you know theboys are salivating they want to surfpipe at it best and so they want thethey want the right call which is notalways easy to make even though we havea few days of competition that we couldrun and and stuff like that they reallywant to make sure that it\\'s good for theSurfers yeah and we just got a list ofthe teams and the team names so we\\'vegot teamJapan uh they\\'ve always uh representedwell yeah definitely and uh we\\'ve gotnew Earth Project that\\'s with kyeni anduh those guys got a nice roster thereand then na na na is our Brazilian teamBrazilian team yeah definitely comingall the way from Brazil to compete hereon the pipelineand then uh team96712 that is our Northshore zip codeit\\'s actually H Eva zip code believe itor not when you live at Sunset Beachyour address is still haliva yeah whenyou live up POA your address is stillhaliva when you live all the way down bythe bolt Harbor your address is halivaso that that zip code might be one ofthe widest ranging zip codes broad rangefor sure because um yeah there\\'s milesand miles of uh distance between of96712 and then team snapped five thesnapped group always uh putting on agreat show Northshore boys I like thatNSB NSPaction and then tubos Peru our Peruvianteam they always have a good Groenperuvians we do like them a lot they puton a great show and team vul which isalways in the mix again this is kind oftheir spot we\\'re actually at the vulhouse running this uh broadcast andstuff like that so these guys on teamvom seasoned they actually get to watchthis spot on a daily surf it on a dailyso they\\'re definitely got the best uhreal estate for being at pipeline yousee those pukas in the reef right therefrom that Dronefootage and uh sometimes the wave canstuff you in one of those holes and yeahnot let you out for a while it\\'s adefinitely very D scary momentdefinitely verydangerous you see all the the bubblesand stuff on the inside it\\'s allwhitewash and stuff that\\'s another areawhen it does get big you you you can getyou can get detached from your boardlost in it there\\'s all kinds ofvariables that can happen here at pipeit\\'s definitely one of the the mostdangerous waves in the world I I believeyeah it it\\'s um got I think the thehighest number of fatalities yeah um andwe\\'ve seen there\\'s a good techniqueright there the wave just kind of ranaway but these guys are kind of killingit on this body nice tunnel vision wecall[Laughter]itH4 yeah so we do have a really goodlineup here for round one for the men\\'sshort boarddivision uh which is strong potentialthey\\'re going to run today yeah stillconf confirming if uh if that is on forsure we\\'ll standby so we will have uh a a short breakright after this body surfingheat and uh have about maybe a 10 or 15minute break and then uh we\\'ll get rightinto we are going to go to round one oneshortboard surfing so stay tuned folkswe\\'ve got the exciting team shortboardsurfing coming up after this bodysurfing we hope we hope uh the swelldoes fill in and if it does that\\'s whatthe boys want to see and they want toride and here\\'s a couple of sets for thebody surface rolling through here youcan see them still having a blast withabout eight minutes left in their bodyserfheat and then we\\'ll roll into a breakand then start the men\\'s shortboardwell talk about putting your body on theline uh you know this pipeline bodysurfing is a big commitment and everytime you catch awave almost every time you\\'re justgetting pummeled and rolled and twistedand Ed and there\\'s nothing for you tograb on to to float and rest you got toswim back out so these guys are truewave Warriors and you know this is ohand going back door right there yeahback door action I I believe this isprobably highly likely cuz I wasn\\'taround back then but highly likely thatuh this was the first form of Surfingusing the body before you found anythingelse to ride even if it wasn\\'t a line orsh bre using yourbodyso we\\'ve got uh little set comingthrough here about 645remainingand nobody taking that one right therekind of a closeup but that was a prettygood little back door wave get a pulledoff a spinner you know some of theManeuvers that uh these body serverswill do is that spin or that roll andthen um obviously getting in the barrelpipe one right here and they\\'re tryingto stay that rightthere and I\\'m just getting a messagefrom my cousin Christa actually there\\'sa uh a dead sperm whale at Marone rightnow so uh stay out of the water in themar area just a heads up if you\\'reheading east or you know past the NorthShore up you know in the kohokuarea uh there is a report of a a deadwhale and you know what uh goes for thedead whale carcass is our friends theMano the big fish the Mano the sharks sojust uh be heads up yeah if you\\'reheading to that area that\\'s uh towardsNorthern unofficial report we got butwe\\'ll uh keep youposted it\\'s the food chainright so uh we got a couple of setsrolling through here some peopletaking these body Surfers are working tostay in the position like we saidearlier it\\'s a constant swimming whenyour body surfing especially here atpipeline therip uh can suck you down the beach orout so you kind of want to stay in thepocket there and wait for that setposition yourselves there\\'s a lot goingon there that we don\\'t really see whenyou\\'re out there and you see all thesebody Surfers opting for some some formof swimFin and uh you know I have a a favoritebrand uh the soft kicks with the roundedum the rounded ends are are some of myfavorite I I don\\'t like the real longblades I like theshorter um you know more compact as wesee our cing County lifeguards finestthere daily duties of Beach and Oceansafety thank you very much definitelyocean safety lifeguards day in

gladI\\'m not um a judge today for sure forthis event a judge on this body surfingevent that is difficult navigating forsure and we\\'ve got some viewers tuningin from all parts of the world want togive a shout out to a particular area Iknow there\\'s some folks watching inJacksonville Beach Florida oh yes siryeah there\\'s about a 5our timedifference from here to the east coastso it\\'s uh late in the afternoon andthey\\'re enjoying watching the actionfrom this year\\'s the hoie backdoorshootout andum sounds like we\\'re going to get intothe shortboardcompetition and feature oh oh how

you got to kind of have uhyou know nerves of Steel to like be likejust looking not looking where you\\'regoing yeah backwards at pipe at pipelineyeah with no mas or snarkon just about a minute 30 in this bodysurf event uh the one Heat finalinviting some of oahu\\'s best bodySurfersto have pipeline TOS for 25 minutes wellworth the entry fee for sure definitelyworth it plus the bragging rights youknow the different events that we haveat this competition is what makes itspecial as well honor ofDuke yeah the water is just beautiful soclearit\\'s almost like you\\'re swimming aroundin a pool yeah with how clear the wateris the visibility must be amazingunderwater as we\\'re seeing it beautifulfrom above you see that really definedgeon theedge of the sandar to TheSandbaryeah and some of the last waves of thisbody surfing Heat beingridden the guys scored right in the endof the heat they got some W and uh youknow another Brave part about bodysurfing is uh your lack of swimwear yourof coverage you sometimes are going forthe speedo I always body surf in boardshorts yeah that\\'s just uh my within mycomfort zone or you can go with theSpeedos shave off some time yeah get getthe extra speedspeedso the body surfing heat iscomplete so we\\'ll takea so with that uh completion of the bodysurfing heat we\\'re going to take a acommercial break and we\\'ll be back withmore back door shootout and have uh therest of the schedule set up for you staytuned stay tunedgangshe[Music]my[Laughter]foreignspeespee[Music]foreignall right welcome back everybody to the2024 thei backdoorshootout brought to youby Kiki Bungalows and guts Havi uh weare here on the shores of oahu\\'sNorthshore a hukai beach park the Bonsaipipeline going into our round number oneof the men\\'s shortboard uh divis isionwe are going to get into it today uh wejust finished up uh longboard divisionour standup paddle division as well asour body surfing competition here and souh that was in honor of theDuke and uh what used to be the oceanFest and so uh we\\'re going to head upinto the round one of the men\\'sshortboard division today so we arestanding by right now for the start ofthe shortboarddivision round one we have we have TeamJapan Team new EarthProject we got na96712 snapped five the NorthShore boysturbos Peru and vcum those are the teamscompetingtoday and uh the way it worksis uh which is what makes the back doorshootout uh unique is basicallythe way that the uh competition is runyou know it\\'s unlike most individualfocused events where we actually surf inteams a rider surfing teams of fivecompetitors and you basically accumulatepoints by waves ridden um and so you dohave an individual portion where eachindividual is up for for for winning aswell as the teams and souh that\\'s basically where we\\'re atand uh that was the horn that startedthe heat so team Japan is out there andso in in a more conventional eventyou\\'re going to have a you knowelimination format where uh you\\'ll be umyou\\'ll be in a heat with four other guysand then the top two advance and youkeep surfing to stay alive like thatright but in this format it is uh youjust get to Surf rounds and try to getyour best waves uh in any portion of thethe rounds and then your scores added upafter so there\\'s no elimination rightwhich is an awesome way to hold a surfevent I believe it\\'s um one of the bestformats you could have 100% and uh thisis one of the best competitions it\\'sactually pretty much like a competitionfor the Surfersright kind of geared up for the Surfersand and they do have a safe the wavesthey you know they want to ride whenit\\'s decent and they\\'re out thereeveryday surfing so they kind of knowwhat the waves are doing out there anduh when when they should run it andstuff like that so they do take heed toa lot of the Surfers especially the onesthat uh do surf every day and then ourjudging scale goes up to 12 right we gobeyond the 10 above and beyond and thenour judging crew is a pretty wellexperienced surf crew of Flynn NovakBarton Lynch love hodell Joel C all havehad many many years of experiencesurfing here and I\\'m Rocky Canon we gotCliff Bello we got Isaiah Walker andEzra Rodriguez also doing uh Merry Gorounding our announcer and then we\\'vegot this special guest we got Maka KaiRothman with us in the booth right nowMaka goodmorning kman my littlebrother how\\'s this Trio watch outgang you know it\\'s pretty crazy when uhJapan touches the water I swear it\\'s uhthe waves start the last years theyprobably had the best waves in theirHeats and um right now as soon as theytouch the water a set came so I\\'m hopingthey bring the swell in because by thisevening it\\'s going to be pumping maybethey maybe they brought that energy ofthat 7.4 they just had over there huhand the the magic of Team Japan we\\'veseen perfect 12 go down with kto masuokain the past you know Chargers uhGat H Kenshin Matsunaga Jin Suzuki riaruIto and Sasuke kawatani some of thenewer Japanese names that um are comingonto the scene and these guys chargeit\\'s almost like every time I heard RIruo the waves was a 10 or 11 orsomething every time he takes off backdoor front door side door doesn\\'t mattertakes off he\\'s going to get a scorepaper plastic door like they get inJapan don\\'t matter screen door there\\'sno more screen door screen door and allthe rice paper door yeah coming fromsomebody like Mak Kai Rothman too thatsays a lot you know always keeping aneye on who\\'s surfing what um admiringcertain Surfers you know coming fromsomebody like that who does charge hasbeen Char about charging I tell you whatthese Japanese Surfers have something intheir blood they absolutely charged likeBeyond charge it\\'s just goes to showthat a Japanese Surfer has his ownlineup atpipelight the other day he caught a wavethat was I mean insane and uh stilldoing it the guy yeah still doing itstill well and I\\'m showing these guysreally really taking the initiative tobe the Pioneer I I would say of JapaneseSurfers out here and um his uh hisknowledge and you can tell they sitwhere he sits a lot of them are sittingdeep a lot of them are charging superearly waves and good if you\\'re listeningMahal the years that you gave us and youstill continue to give us brother youinspire us all really good mentoringgood mentoring for for sure uh his sontaii also you know getting some GreatWaves out here and and his daughterSarah she rips too the whole familyserves yeah they\\'re they\\'re just a agreat surfing Ohana and um have made themove here to the NorthShore been herefor decades and I mean mom\\'s in thewater too yeah she\\'s totally ripping hiswife is out that V putting into barrelsit\\'s good to see them integratethemselves into this NorthshoreCommunity you know has been here for along time he stayed here raised hisfamily here and um it\\'s just beautifulto see uh other people coming from otherplaces and integrating themselves 100%what makua just said um you know if youchoose to call hav home you know welcomebut uh it\\'s also you have a kulana aresponsibility too and they they likeMak said Japanese they really have ahuge heart they come here they\\'re humbleculture culturally culturally respectfulCally I mean proper in my eyes they theyreally have a lot of respect they bowthey you know just the way that theJapanese do things a lot of the timereally can be emulated in a lot ofcultures because they\\'ve got we\\'ve got alot to learn from their kind of culturefor sure for sure for sure and youmentioned uh how hard they charge and II man I I tell you it\\'s that samuraiwarrior spirit that comes out especiallyat a place like pipe where you got tohave nerves of Steel and ready to goready to die basically last year I gothurt K got Grace got really hurt mybrother just got his face smashed Kennyserves the biggest waves planet Earthand then let\\'s not forget about thething about pipeline is I believe it\\'smuch more dangerous on a day like thisthan any big day and any big wave spotbecause most of the times when you servebig waves oh my God it\\'s so crazy butit\\'s deep it\\'s pretty water you knowevery once in a while you get unlucky atthe bottom but pipeline it\\'s not deep ifyou look right now and they zoom in atback door a place called an The Reefsticking out of the water are walkingout yeah you you could be in ankle deepwater coming out of a 10-ft barrel rightnow and uh it just goes to show thatSamurai that that mentality you have tohave knowing you\\'re putting it all onthe line and um and potenti great riskgreat reward as well I mean getting inone of these barrels and coming outthat\\'s like you\\'re on cloud nine yeahand then the very next wave you take offyou could be injured knocked out youknow in near death or or worse and it\\'sjust how quickly things can happendefinitely oh yeah definitely it\\'s uhand the extremes right you know the themost amazing feeling ever and then theworst ever yeah I wonder if we have anyuh replays from last year by any chancefrom the Japanese uh maybe we could getsome of those waves from show you whatwe\\'re talking about right now the oceanreally not cooperating with the Surfersuh at this moment but should those wavesarrive it will be a uh the forecast isuh frenzy out there potential yeah surfline is calling for the swell toincrease throughout the day um it\\'swe\\'ve seen some little hints of the fourrunners but nothing really significantquite yet but we know it\\'s on the way Ithink when the swell pushes it\\'s goingto bring the uh the tide excuse me thetide comes up it\\'s going to push theswell and that\\'s when it\\'s going tostart banging for me I mean tell you thetruth I could really care less how thewaves are right now I to heat six and Iwe pull the names out of aso yeah you did the numbersyeah so that\\'s another uh cool uh partof the format uh and and Cliff mentionedit earlier of the the Surfers kind of umthis is an event for the Surfers by theSurfers in a in a way to where the orderof the team surfing is determined bypulling a number out of the hat or aname or team name out of the hat so youput them all you crumble up paper CHthem in s hat and then you mix them upand you know look and you Gra grab blindgrab and then well I mean I looked yeahwe well uh I walked up to the ball and Iseen heat one and I definitely wasn\\'tpicking that one and then I seen heateight on the side I definitely wasn\\'tpicking that one so kind of closed myeyes after that he SI so oh yeah wetalked about we talked about uh writingthe rules and thatyeah on the who thing rules none letRock so these are 30 minute Heats uhwith eight Heats that gives us uh fourhours ofcompetition uh and right now and that\\'swhat you\\'ll see too in this format is anon-elimination so it\\'s not like you gotto scramble around looking for a scoreneeding a twoo five whatever cherry pickpatience picking the right waves and umyou know a lot of opportunity for us toVol all because they\\'re just cruisingcuz we like to do that too s you knowwith all this fancy forecasting thereare definitely wrong surf line my lineyour line whatever line was uh seaweedyweather whatever you call it even5101 uh you know it\\'s just supped toshow that mother nature does what shewants and um thank you very much foreverybody for your support and giving usthe opportunity to have those forecastsbut um like guy hogi would say the wavesis firing tomor yeah somewhere somewherejust uh now but you know what\\'s awesomeabout this contest is to serve pipelineregardless with four guys in the waterno one out I mean and it\\'s your friendit\\'s your friend today could just be a auh uh what do you call free surf dependshow the waves are it could be anexpressing session there you have twomore three more full days of competitionthat means six more rounds of Surfing ifwe really want to got a nice crowdassembling on the beach all the fansassembled here to watch you know myfavorite phrase that I made up for a daylike today when you see the young kidswith the old folks the all AG rer theall a rer allboss all boss rer allboss so we got some nuggets now this iswhat we have to for packingit that was so this is what we\\'rewaiting for it\\'s hopefully going tostart to pulse here but uh that\\'s thebeauty of this competition too is it\\'sfor the Surfers by the surface so theydon\\'t really have to jump to any sort ofuh EmerRush start and stuff like that we wantto kind of wait for the waves to come inoh yeah we we we want the waves you knowone of my favorite uh events that usedto happen and I think that\\'s where a lotof this this contest kind of emanatedfrom as we watch a nice pipe wave rightthere on the backand team Japan oh lookcomes alive and the crowd appreciatesthat make sure you guys go to theoi.comto check out the merchandise from thisevent and uhget it sent right to your doorstep as wewatch a replay Mak the grab railtechnique yeah just really setting hisline I mean negotiating those bumps yousee how that wave is growing and and andand shrinking just like inhaling andexhaling yeah well it\\'s really um kindof volatile out there for lack of betterwords the Sand Bar is still therethere\\'s a little bit of a hill on thebeach um there\\'s a little bit ofbackwash in the water as you can see andum right now just perfectly navigatingthat Barrel um putting himself in themost critical deepest part as possibleand um that\\'s awesome because we get tohave ascale they\\'re going to set the scale nowthere\\'s awave there\\'s a barrel made yeah and umit\\'ll really give the judges anopportunity and that\\'s definitely notthinking about scale right nowdefinitely not one job I\\'d want is totry and set the scale especially in yourfirst heat cuz supposed to have sizecome in I mean that\\'s the hard partright what do you give that it\\'s kind oflike we call it the guine Pig heat rightthey go out and test the conditions youknow we\\'ve seen the long boarders thepaddle boarders the stand ERS you knowthat\\'s a little bit differentshortboarding you know uh you\\'reapproaching the wave in a totaldifferent perspective yeah I mean it\\'syou don\\'t really hear anybody reallycomplaining about size yeahyeah and so when uh that score comes inwe\\'ll see you know how far up the scalethere\\'s still a lot of room in the scalebut you said maku that wave was justlike flexing and breathing and tonavigate through that backside in thatbarrel and make it out that is sometechnical skill right inside there tellthe waves are just starting to try andcome up it\\'s trying to figure itself outlike the toddlerwalking kind of getting their foot ingiraff you know pipeline it kind of doesthat like morning sickness sometimes andweight the waves could be you know up 10to 12 ft but until that Sun hits it andthe wind blows it kind it\\'s funky sopipeline goes through its moodsespecially when the waves are coming upand you see that line right there Rockyon your screen that is supposed to beall reef and right now from a large westill have that very shallow Sandbarlook for that sandbar to come intoeffect we need the home plate umpire tocome with his brush and brush off thewhole plate right there expose The Reefa little bit more guys are definitelygoing to have to not just negotiate thereef and the barrel when you come outwhen it gets bigger and it startsrunning off into that sandar you\\'regoing to see some spectacDismount some Carnage Sone bio styleonebio definite Carnage you know tripequipment is going to be tested the bodyis going to betested forsure uhoh I we\\'re looking some linescoming throughhere who do we got right there in theline look like Shimp huchi team captainShimp like he\\'s uh you out the back andPole Position hey but one of my favoriteevents when you when you mentioned theword expression session was the hoiesunset expression session that was somuch fun that was such a great we have ataker right here super just nonjudgeevent like as good as it gets for justlike having a locals go out and enjoythe waves exactly and then this eventkind of borne off of that idea but thenmixed in you know the scoring and theteam concept but definitely feels morelike an expression session than a surfcontest I mean there is there is so manygreat contests from the honolua shootoutto the sunset shootout to the you knowback door shootout here at uh atPipeline and it\\'s just awesome to seethat you know people getting out therenot having to you know it\\'s awesome thisevent is different and it\\'s good in away that you don\\'t see your favoriteSurfer lose you can follow your Surferthrough the four days of competition youknow just like right now you could haveone heat that maybe the waves aren\\'t asgood the next 3 days it\\'s firing get tobecause of one day all of asudden judged on you know this type ofwave and it\\'s awesome to see everybodygetting multiple uh chances to Surf andto show their skills and to show whatthey can do in any uh any conditions andright now just because it\\'s like this inthis heat that doesn\\'t mean that a teamJapan person couldn\\'t win this event noproblem in one of their next year yeahexactly no well said well said andthat\\'s why the format is is such uh forthe surface ERS to be able to Showcaseyour ability in a few days of Surfingyou know so it\\'s not just set to yourone heat Wonder kind of a deal yeah uhin fact it was one of our team Japanguys um in the past that got not only aperfect 12 in this event but that was awave of the winter winner oh thatbackside yeah that bomb on the back handthat was just and and I think uh yourbrother Co yeah was uh on a pipe perfect12 that I didn\\'t even know how he cameout of that barelanyway oh talk about wave of the winteryeah this guy has so many wave of thewinters we have on screen James DuncanO\\'brien James D D Mr J O and up andriding on the back dooring back no waywow screen door no screen good chance atalmost a perfect ride honestly I mean hehe made it he made it pretty far forsure to the close out at eight yeahand he\\'s probably thankful he\\'s got hishelmet on yeah sh huchi like I said teamcaptain p positionI he wasn\\'t going to let that wave go byand here we go on the replay Rocky Imean look at this perfect positioning inearly beautiful Bott turn the line wasas good of a chance as he was going toget you know it was just the wave notcooperating but his line was perfecteven if there wasn\\'t that crumble and itstayed open to the end and then closedout he would have had a chance to Doggybut that chandel kind of this winds toblow tell you if this wind blows and theti pushes little trade uh grooming yeahocean just absolutely changes Spar youknow Cliff being a being a firstresponder ocean safety specialist Hawaiiwatero you know how conditions changeout here in the lineup especially yeah100% conditions mean everythingespecially when you\\'re talking about thewind that direction is going to like yousaid holds it open so that chandelierisn\\'t going to be uh an issue buteverything kind of has a line up like aperfect storm kind of a deal I mean youspent so many years out there in thelineup on the jety how many times haveyou seen the conditions go from maybenot perfect to absolutely firing in likematter minutes and that\\'s I can\\'t evencount the amount of times but that\\'skind of like one of the things we knowhere growing up on the North Shore thatit can be what you see right now to tensand twelves in in 30 minutes you knowlike that\\'s just how many times we\\'veseen that in our life isyou know we would like to see the T andtwelves come in in about two hours I seeI seeyour right around 24 spot on over hereteam you see all those cracks and pukasthose holes in the reef it is not likethis perfectly like flat area there\\'sdefinite Contours uh and uh like yousaid um earlier Cliff the topographyyeah of what\\'s below EXA affects theshape of the wave but also man it islike yeah it doesn\\'t get much betterthan this here really dangerous uh onceyou get down there and you get forcedinto one of those cracks or those thoseholes man should sh have come out ofthat Barrel that would have it\\'s on Imean it looks like it\\'s coming theforecast is there we\\'re just uh theseand these these uh the Drone shots andall the footage we\\'re getting from Oceanpatter TV is just incredible you get Kaathere in thebackdrop Mount kalala yeah it\\'s adefinite um wish you were here type ofsetting and views of Team new EarthProject right there more there checkingin at the beach Marshals as well yeah soawesome to see the integration of ourwahen Surfers Moana Jones Wong she\\'salso inuh this event so she\\'s coming off hermost recent pipe victory at the Vancepipe Masters is Moana Jones Wong andKarissa will was in that final and she\\'salso going to be surfing with Team newEarth Project oh it\\'s awesome to seeCaris out here you know uh it wasforecasted to be really big and andpipeline only and you know she has anevent coming up so she was kind of likeoh I wonder and the conditions areabsolutely perfect especially for herright now she\\'s been putting on such aclinic out here for the women and it\\'sso good to see you know Carissa pushingwomen\\'s levels of Surfing as well youknow because there really aren\\'t thatmany women who really wanted out thereyou know I was asked online about whyisn\\'t there more women and why this andthat and I said hey women are more thanwelcome to have a team yeah and it\\'sreally I don\\'t think they understand asyou see on screen right here CarissaMoore I mean she is an absolute animalyeah you there\\'s only so many girls thatcharge on this planet that want it Imean there\\'s plenty girls that willcharge here and there but to actuallycome back time and time again andactually want it you know it\\'s very fewand the Very and those girls deserve alot of respect they\\'re really on theForefront of something here especiallypushing women\\'s athletic sports inextreme conditions to another level andbeing a five time world champion is ityeah five time at the same time andbreaking out of that comfort zone ofbeing able to you know surf a certainstyle of competition and wave to comingout here and really putting her titleson the line it really goes to show howmuch of a real true champion sheactually and her health on the line tooI mean this is pipe you know it\\'s she\\'sout there charging with the boys I meanthat\\'s I really would like to see herwearing a helmet tell you the truth Imean that\\'s just me and pipeline if younotice yeah you\\'re going to get hurt alot of the times on these smaller daysmore than the big days DustyPjoanka Kenny just now I mean you namedit my brother the other day I mean itjust goes across the books I mean backin the day when Uncle Terry was pullingpeople out out of the water here thesekind of before when when helmets werenon-existent I mean they\\'re they\\'re herenow right so that\\'s one of the things islike technology we use the computer weuse the iPhone we use everythingtechnologically advanced to better bebetter and and so why wouldn\\'t you thehelmet is there well anything to to toprotect your life safy first right A lotof people oh I can\\'t this I can\\'t thatit\\'s like no you just don\\'t want to looka certain way it has a certain aestheticand I\\'ll stay I used to have to wear ahelmet no matter if I liked it or not Iwas forced to wear a helmet young sa mylife lot time and a lot of times Ididn\\'t get shots in the magazine or andit was kind of trippy that oh becauseyou got a helmet on you weren\\'t going toget a cover shot kind of we to changethe stereotype of what people think iscool who gives a rip that Smith it\\'sabout being smart being safe you don\\'tsee Tony Hawk skating those waves uhskating those ramps or Danny Way jumpingthe the uh Great Wall of China without ahelmet on yeah and especially here inthe like we have Ohana to think about tofamily you want to go home to and stuffso there\\'s no reason why you shouldn\\'tyou\\'re correct in that as you know youknow especially at the world\\'s deadliestwave pipeline yeahtotally100% just about little over halfwaythrough this first first heat heat ofour team surfing team Japan getting usstarted and um you know some of theWaves it looks like like you said makcopipeline still trying to figure itselfout a little bit the Surfers trying tofigure out you know what\\'s going to havemore opportunity is it back door is itpipe uh really calm winds right now juststarting pick up a little bit you see alittle texture on the ocean right thereand the coconut leaves are starting tomove like I said you\\'re going to feelthat wind like that cool breeze on yourneck the wind\\'s blowing on your facehere at pipeline you don\\'t want that youwant that Cool Breeze right in the backof your leg maybe your right ear littlemore than your left ear and uh that is anice southeasterly Direction and ass Salwind is not very you know it\\'s we\\'re onthe North Shore people think oh SouthWinds it\\'s it\\'s a little differentbecause the way that we\\'re angled we\\'reon the North Shore but our North Shoreis actually facing west kind of becauseof the way that aahu shap that thatdownside the like Norwest yeah so it\\'skind of like a you know the winds get alittle bit tricky here you figure eastSoutheast would be a good wind NorthNorthwest WestNorthwest Southwest we like the swellscoming from that direction from theNorthwest and the wind coming from theother direction the East yeah Southeastkind of almost opposite that\\'s butthat\\'s why this place is so so specialand that\\'s why I mean all of us wereborn here but not by choice we just werelucky and we\\'re blessed for sure youknow over the the decades I a lot offolks I I entertain at Turtle Bay and Itake you know out of the ocean they likeoh you know is it just because thiswaves are so big I go not only the wavesbig and the swells but the winddirection is just perfect most of thetime that\\'s why it\\'s so good all thetime it just gets groomed if the wavesare big and it\\'s blowing on Shore it\\'scrap nobody\\'s going to be out there belike I want to watch today go well feelthis wind direction the sw\\'s here butthe wind\\'s wrong and so they alwaysthat\\'s kind of the U uh like theForgotten uh component you know is thatwind Direction\\'s got to be just R thewind direction is everything becausewithout the wind blowing out in the seayou\\'re not having a storm to p wavesanyway 100% it\\'s so important and peopleforget about that a lot the thing is thewind and the storm that blows the waythat it it the way the fetches and theway that the wind blows on top of theocean to put that pressure and blowthose swells to shore has to come fromthat northwesterly direction buthopefully it brings southeasterly windsometimes the storms are big and theysuck the winds towards them or when theyget too when the storm comes too closeto it brings the weather want the stormto say you know just send the that 1500to 500 mile radius and really push upand across let that swell come down andhopefully the wind you counteract thatand come from the opposite direction youknow that\\'s why uh you attach the wordmiracle to this coastline so muchbecause it is just perfectly situatedit\\'s a gem tohave multiple days of Epic conditionsevery winter and it\\'s crazy how like youknow I work at aokai lifeguard Towerbefore in July we\\' be sitting there andpeople come up you know where\\'s thewaves so I thought this was like the bigsurf spot where\\'s the waves like oh bulike wrong season six month short sixmonths to mask and snork they do theirresearch on everything else besides whenthe waves are going and it\\'s just thefun encounters we have seasons right wehave seasons like everywhere else theyjust people think that the weather staysthe same year round because Hawaii butwe have seasons just like everyeverywhere else just our seasons changein the ocean around here so you knowOctober it starts to to build and youget the first swells and then in thesummer as we see a back dooropportunity look atthatthat\\'s yeah wow that was a t right therewow and that\\'s why I don\\'t want thejudges the judges job right now becausewow that was for the morning a 10 12 howdo you not give that a 10-point ride Iknow it\\'s the second barrel of thecontest but I mean like you can\\'t getany more Barrel that back door a bigerwave he was in this for so long look atthis perf line pumps gets that speed heneeds right there he\\'s G it again oh andthen he doggy doors man handles you knowsometimes watching on a screen it\\'s hardto tell what the wave is doing furtherdown the line yeah so you\\'re really likeokay I\\'m not sure about it looks good sofar but at any moment that wave couldshut down cuz there such a small uhwindow that you get when looking on thescreen oh man that was amazing big Japanwillhave I don\\'t care how found Japan hitsthe water it\\'s on yeah jeely the jam onlike popcornI\\'m not exactly sure which Surfer thatwas yeah pretty sure guys s those goofyJapan though but culturally we\\'repositive Japan that it was Japan uhwhether it was a sasuki kawatani orkinhin Matsunaga well or or JinSuzuki not sure that\\'s the question butultimately cuz you know like I said wedon\\'t have jerseys because we don\\'t needthe the uh judges do have a spotter sothe team sends a spotter up to thejudges Tower to make sure they\\'ve gotthe right individual well that\\'s that\\'san awesome thing about this event aswell is you wear your team\\'s colors youwear your sponsor stuff you don\\'t go outthere and have some big old thingsmeared across the front of your jerseythat someone else is paying for andgetting money for and of course theSurfers get nothing like we\\'ve seen inthe past for so many years this contestyou\\'re in you wear your stuff you wantto wear a jersey you don\\'t want to wearone you want to wear a certain uh a lotof the times back in the day a lot ofthe companies would have their uham Jerswell they would have their marketingshoots because they only have four guysin the water at pipeline the waves wouldbe firing so they get all their shotswith all their new stuff and everythingno photo bombers you get the line upnice and clear you know during theshootout and that that\\'s one of theawesome things about the shootout is wedon\\'t push you know our stuff on anybodywe just uh that everybody go out thereand express a platform yeah there anopportunity to they wish and um I\\'m yetto see the uh you know Once Upon a Timeguys like kah Hart Brian amona where theSpeedos out there to see if there\\'s aseen j o with his uh you know Speedocompany one of his merch items and maybehe\\'ll drop a line with his speed rightyou know he\\'ll be on a soft top with aSpeedo Speedo step off just uh taking itto I wonder if he has like an impactvest does he have any floaties in theSpeedos to make sure like I know he likspeed yeah he\\'s got his impact suit onand uh I think he wearing that guy hasreally changed the way content iscreated for the sport of Surfing yeah hehit a million followers I mean in in thegrand scheme of things you know in thesurf world for athlete to transitionover from competitive surfing to reallycontent creation and and what he\\'s donereally really leading the charge inpioner in our industry in in ourdiscipline and Sport uh Mr Jamie O\\'Brienreallyyou know showing the next Generation howto monetize themselves through contentcreation yeah I know totally and you hitthe nail on the head with that becauseguys did have to make adjustments youknow in order to make a living doingsomething they love doing and so hedefinitely pioneered it he\\'s been verysuccessful with it and you know kudos tohim and for spearheading it for the nextGeneration too you know I watch yourbrother call guys and everybodytraveling all over the world you knowsurfing these waves and get building upcontent but basically enjoying the lifeyou know living their life it\\'s awesomegot some uh good information uh from ourfriend Mark denzer chiming in he\\'swatching online and um hearing usmention about the winds and the morningsickness and he\\'s spent a lot of timesailing around these islands and um iskind of corroborating the thatphenomenon you know talking abouttalking about chiming in online it wasso crazy CU When I Was announcing at thevan pipe Masters yeah there\\'s somebodywith a maku rasman official on theYouTube with the commentsI mean the comments weren\\'t actuallythat bad like you know I was he had somepretty cool stuff to say here and therebut I\\'m like who is this person like theguys are like I couldn\\'t believe you Iseen your thing and I\\'m like I\\'mannouncing announcing there\\'s no chanceover there doing this thing but it\\'s itwasuh yeah chatGPT yeah that that\\'s uh you tell St notfollowing All Along The Narrative I likethat you got to do itstay in your lane right well team Japanjust a few minutes remaining but theyhave uh made this first heat well worthit yeah with a couple of nice rides onein particular that at back door was uhdefinitely the best wave we\\'ve seen theentire day long borders stand uppaddlers body Surfers all getting somenice waves but man that back door wavewas the wave of the day so far yeah anduh setting the bar kind of high rightthere set in the bar uh our head judge Idon\\'t know what he called itbut got to be breaking double digits Ithink maybe cuz we go up to 12 right sowell that\\'s got to be a 10 especiallyfor a 10 how much Long Bar going to getit\\'s got to be yeah excellent here we gowe\\'re checking out uh recap on the pipethere you go there\\'s the pipe one thatwas the one we saw early biger a littlebigger but way shorter than this this isreminds me of Kelly Slater when he wonhis last pipe Master Pumps and picks hisline really another section anothersection wow I mean that speed he gotthere that was just beautiful crazy hestoked for sure and he was very uhfortunate not to get lipped right in thehead of the last part of it and getknocked off the board so good I almostthinks the judges will probably givethat around an 8.5 I would see 8 8.5because of the size of the W because thewaves are coming up today somebody getsone that twice the size just as longthey need the room in the scale to beable to get to that perfect score andthen to that super perfect score welland we\\'ve you know having all of thisdocumented with video we do have thechance and in years past we\\'ve used thatto go back and adjust scores asappropriately needed because you want tomake sure especially if you have thechance to to CU you seeing it one timethrough it\\'s hard to just write down anumber right there you know sometimes itdoesn\\'t do it justice seeing it multipletimes comparing it to other waves givesyou a chance to really get that numberas accurate as possible correct yeahalso having different angles of the wavetoo see you know from the front sidecamera position is key and I see waveskind of starting to come together reallyset the looks like it\\'s kind of startingto double up a little bit so I\\'m fairlyconfident I\\'m almost guaranteeing thatby the end of the day it will be pumingby the time the NorthShore boys uh byNorthshore Surf Shop team hits the wateruh that\\'s what he\\'s putting in theuniverse it\\'s it manifest it and it willcome manifesting it right now Makai hasa way with about theJapanese and how when they get in thewater they score and talk about there\\'sthe team team Japan the real teamcaptain there uh for team Japanmonitoring he\\'s making sure they\\'redoing the right thing you know makingsure his boys are not pulling back yeahhis horses his horses are running thefull race right now little little morethan 30 seconds left in theheat oh 30 secondsoh looks like teamgot some lines coming in yeah linescoming in New Earth Project is makingtheir way out

eventsbut I know he enjoys this format of youknow pressure-free non-eliminationsurfing with your friends yeah and thewaves look like they\\'re getting waybetter I I was down there during mybreak and just watched the waves improveright before my eyes uh Team Japan had acouple good that back door wave that wasinsane he was in there for so long hewent through a couple different sectionsand I was telling uh Maka and Cliffsometimes when we\\'re looking on screenyou don\\'t get to see the it\\'s so zoomedin you can\\'t tell what\\'s happening downthe wave right so you\\'re not sure you\\'relike oh it looks good right here butthere could be this closeout section orsomething so I kept waiting for it tolike shut down and it never did to ouruh great pleasure to watch that and umfortunately for our team Japan Surferwas able to make it all the way throughlooks like there\\'s a wavehere our Surfers looking at this lookslike Jamie O\\'Brien paddling for this onelate drop classic j o stalls dragsbehind the spit yeah comes outye so jo uh you know he\\'s got his uh surfexperience over at Turtle Bay Resort sowe\\'ve uh get to work together a lot umdoing some ocean activities and uh it\\'sgreat to see Jamie still doing it thatgrab rail technique sosignature and as we just said Isaiah thewaves improving by the minute right anduh I know the wind is a little you knowit\\'s not your typical Cai a uh tradewins okay but it\\'s still holding outthere\\'s a minute there it looked like itwas swirling it was a little kind ofUncertain like what the wins we\\'re goingto do but so far so good looks like thethe lineup\\'s really clean and loveseeing Jamie do that I mean he just gotit so dialed the way that he does thisyou see in the this was a replay wemissed this one that\\'s Co withth yeahand Co able to weave through nicely onthe forehand and then the one we justsaw live j o couple of little sectionsthere and the wave kind of a like adouble spitalmost oh amazing you see how he ejectedright at the sandaryeah looks like he\\'s going again lookingat this little back door inside onestalls pumping controlling his speed sohe can come on of this oh that was onewhere like we said on the screen it\\'s alittle bit of a a zoomed in view so youdon\\'t see the whole wave of what it\\'sdoing down the line and that one lookedsimilar to our Japanese surfer in theheat prior for a few moments it lookedalmost exactly the same but then thatwas one thatactually shut down on the end off screenand then when he finally got there yousaw that close out withoutsection yeah you could see that um youknow he\\'s trying to control his speedhere he\\'s slowing down and then he looksforward he sees oh my gosh this wave\\'srunning and\\'s trying to pump and getahead of it but uh it shutsdown you they say that at back doorespecially a lot of times waves thatlook like close outs are are the betterones and so often times it\\'s good tostay here we have a rider up gettingbaral I think that might have beenKarissawe\\'llsee yep that was Karissa and then youknow the trickiest part after you surfyour back door wave is uh that there\\'sno Channel there\\'s no um you know uhspace to have the wave kind of taper offwhere you can make it out and around itis having to power through that reallydumpy section right there and thensometimes you got to come all the wayback aroundall right here goes J Jamie O\\'Brienfinding another waves keeping busy watchhim stall nope go straight under thehood maybe yep drags beautifullydone and with that we\\'re going to takeyou down to the beach with an interviewfrom our Surfers from the lastteam we\\'re here with Kenan Matsunaga whojust scored an epic wave how do you feelright now after scoring that amazingbarrel and coming out on the other sideyeah that wave wasso uh V is so slow but the came yeah andmyfriends uh gave me that wbes yeah yeah Igo to the web pumping pumping and PBOand comes out so stoked awesome sostoked yeah and you pumped just right atthe right time and you got out of it umI know you\\'re here last year so is thisthe best uh wave you\\'ve ever gotten onPipeline best wave uh bestwave awesome thank you greatjob all right so that\\'s confirmed it waskeninMatsunaga the uh suspect isidentified and man he heard him it\\'slike I think that\\'s the best back doorwave I ever caught what a time to do itlive on TV in front of a great Beachcrowd during the hoie back door shootoutyeah what a treat too he looked like apretty younger guy yeah and to go outthere with um you know just some of hisfellow countrymen and from Japan at youknow really good backdoor conditions andto score that wave and it was kind ofcool he said my friend gave me that waveso you know lot of camaraderie at thisevent and um I\\'ll be making a Mark heretoday at the back door shootout thisyoung Kenshin stoked for him yeah and Ithink um you know what we uh all enjoyhaving and being able to do at thisevent is highlight you know some of ourdifferent um countries and cultures thatcome and compete with us uh and U youknow surf alongside us here and thecamaraderie you mentioned but also uh weget to highlight and talk about ourHawaii culture um as well and you\\'re aum a knowledgeable guy everybody knowsthat by now you\\'ve got quite thereputation in the surf uh announcingworld as um as the professor and um asurfing one at that and I\\'ve seen youout you you can rip bro you get somemoves cuz so he credible guys he notonly can talk but this buger can do thewalk he can he can shred and umyou know in Hawaiian culture and surfingand the way it began or you know way itwas uh um performed you know in the pastin ancient times you know there was alot of of that you know sharing of wavesand um you know just uh yeah all thepictures you see is multiple Surfers onthe wave party wave action party wavewell it really depended like today umhow there\\'s a a lot of variety of formsof wave riding I think that\\'s somethingimportant to to that our viewersunderstand is that in in ancient timesin Old Hawaii in kaak kahiko we how wecall it is that um you had a lot ofvariety in surfing as well so there aresome breaks where it was cool to sharewaves uh we see that like especially atthe turn of the 20th century in W keythere\\'s a lot of shots of Duke and hisand the The Beach Boys and others likesharing waves um and that\\'s what it wasyou know in Kaaka heo in Old Timesdepending on the wave and the event youknow in old in Old Times there were alsolike we have here today there wascompetition and so you know certaintimes of the year like right now we\\'rein what\\'s called makahiki and makahikiseason is a time period of uh in hawanculture where there\\'d be a lot ofcompetition and in Old Hawaii prior toWestern contact we had surfingcompetitions like we\\'re seeing hereright now goty get barreled that\\'sCarissa oh Carissa also Hawaiianethnicity and and I\\'m glad that um youknow this this team has a female surferor Wah in it because in ancient times aswell women Surfers were very prominentin the lineup a lot of great Legends ofprobably one of the most famous One i\\'probably shared this story before but ofa female surfer named kalea and we knowa lot of her because her story is a is alengthier one okay um King Davidkakawa uh told the version of this storythat got written down and so kalea isone of many many female Surfers that wasknown asreally skilled and competitive andrevered highly in the waves here we haveoh shpack packing a pipe Barrelso the the brother from Big Island FBIfrom Big Island making it happen here onthe NorthShore and is happy with thatone and it looks likeM oh the waves are turning on yes sirwowlove it and so the more the swell buildsand it\\'s got that Westerly component soit will continue to help kind of pushthat sand off of The Reef I mentioned itlast Heat you know it\\'s like we need thethe kokua home plate umpire to come dustoff home plate you know and uh exposeThe Reef a little more shayen picarogets the first wave of that setbeautifully done on the forehand andthen matah jle scores himself a nicepipe Barrelwoo yeah it\\'s a nice sign when you havebackto back waves that are good likethat and in this heat we\\'ve had severalgreat scoring waves uh ridden so farfrom Mo all of our competitors actuallyalready gotten waves and there\\'s still19 minutes left in this heat so this isa good sign we\\'re seeing a lot of energyright now in theocean but yeah so um back to your yourquestion about uh surfing in in OldHawaii and kaak Kiko um certainly thereare a lot of different types of of ofsurfboards conditions that you wouldsurf would you know vary um they didsurf the NorthShore as well a lot oftimes people assume that like surfingwas only something that was that tookplace in isolated areas in Hawaii but wehave many stories and uh traditions ofof of hawan surfing on theNorthShore um and all around the statein fact uh many of the outer Islands asas well lot of great stories and what wecall moo or these these histories thathave been preserved through oraltradition so most societies before theyhad a written um culture a writtenwritten language uh they would preservetheir stories through song or chant oruh whether it\\'s Gregorian chants in inEurope or in other places but in Hawaiilikewise a lot of our stories were firstpreserved through oral traditions ofchanting here we have it\\'s like Shoagain yeah come on oh yeah that\\'s righthe\\'s from your neck of the woods overthere on the big island yeah Shadenpicaro awesome Surfer from uh you knowfrom Hilo and Puna side and um I lovehis style so smooth uh he\\'s he\\'s got areal cool uh technique to his surfingyes and and like you said earlier Rockyit applies to both small and biggerwaves yeah and that one just got alittle bit small on the end and you knowum along of what we were uh talkingabout earlier we\\'ve got some really coolmessages coming in uh it\\'s nsog Hawaiiat gmail that\\'s how you can um add to amessage to my my inbox here and uh folksknow that from being on the beach at earother events and U we got a nice uhcomment and message from Susie fredmanwatching in Seattle Washington okay anduh you\\'re one of her favorites bro andshe purchased waves of resistance tooactually so great support and Susie wethank you forfor tuning in and um and we uh areexcited to be once again bringing youthe the hoie backdoor sh out she\\'s beenwatching all the replays of previousyears oh wow so we\\'ve uh become kind ofuh familiar voices and faces to her soSusie we thank you and um we are alsohoping that this year the Eddie can runagain because that was so much fun uhthis past January and I can\\'t believeit\\'s already coming up on a year agothat happened year flew by man now Imean if uh if anyone has questions aboutH history or surfing history you\\'d liketo to ask uh maybe you could send it toyou yeah uh nsog Hawaii Gmail um and youknow because this type of event wementioned earlier it\\'s not like theseSurfers need scores and they\\'re like youknow we got a bunch of information wegot to get out because you know there\\'stime remaining there\\'s a scorerequirement we have the freedom at thisevent to be uh much more candid andshare a lot more deeper information thanyou would get at your regularconventional surfing event so andbroadcast so we appreciate we can be alittle bit more pug yeah we can we canexpand make the expansion a little bituh into you know other tangent if youwill uh because the Surfers are alsobeing very selective you know they knowthey have at least two three four morerounds possibly right so they don\\'t haveto get all their scores like today inone round and be this being the firstround around the the um the atmosphereis very relaxed right and pressure freeso we do have the opportunity to expandsend your uh emails nsog Hawaii at Gmailand we\\'ll get it right here so I lovethe Drone footage here you can see thelandscape um and in in Hawaiian uh thethe word for for land is AA okay and butinterestingly the Ina also includes thethe shoreline and the ocean where thewhere the reef and the waves are sothat\\'s something important that alsospeaks to um a a unique perspective thathaian and and also most PacificIslanders in general is that in mostcultures the the ocean or the beach is abarrier right so like people often timestalk about how they have like maybeIsland fever fever because often timesthe ocean becomes something that is avoid or a barrier or some sort ofboundary but in Hawai culture and insurfing cultur we see here today too isthat the ocean is not not um a separatespace it\\'s a it\\'s an extension as we seehere wow that might be matah oh matahextending that Barrel oh it is turningon that was beautifully done so cool methis guy is a master at Barrel ridingwe\\'ve seen so many times a heavy heavychopo in uh in Tahiti and here atpipeline just slipping down the faceslowing himself down out with the spitand he was totallydisappeared uh and also just getting a abit ofinformation uh as it pertainsto different ocean conditions we have wehave a dead sperm whale over atony oh sothat is just a heads up if you\\'re up inthat area uh there is some uh carcass inthe water and on the shoreline you see apicture of it right there Isaiah and umknow that means you know what followsthose uh pieces of carcasses and the bigfish up in that area thankfully that\\'syou know some miles from here so we\\'renot experiencing uh any immediate effectof that but as a just a kind of alert toour folks here on aahu that if you\\'re upin that Northeastern kahoku area yeahthere\\'sa a big old dead sperm whale on thebeach on the reef so just be careful butwe\\'ve got Nice condition here it hasbeen uh you know kind of that um notsuper overcast but just a little cloudcover so it\\'s not super bright sunnyblue skies it\\'s got that kind of ominouslittle gray kind of flat Lighting on ituh I think it has kept the wind a littlebit at Bay a little but the trades nowstarting to fill in and pipeline doeslike a little bit of a offshore groom ifyou will yep forsureyeah so I mean any questions you haveabout um Hawaiian history and umthankful to our viewer from Seattle whopurchased uh waves of resistance sowaves of resistance is a book uh that Ipublished in boy about 10 years ago andum in there is a lot of the histories ofSurfing um but it\\'s really I I think inmany ways I\\'ve I\\'ve sort of trickedpeople I don\\'t want to say it in thatway but people think oh I\\'m going tojust learn about surfing but then afterreading it you\\'re like wow I learned alot about history with Hawaii in thePacific surfing is the way you reel themin right and then uh you get to reallyum you know get a deep dive if you willno pun intended into um uh some of themore historical content which I think isuh really important to discuss and umwe\\'ve got uh Captain Richard tuning inuh and uh Scott Crouch also so you guysuh hanging out with us on our broadcastwe appreciate it and um oh we got lookslike clay maro\\'s Mom oh timing uhchiming in and um I saw his name on theroster somewhere so yeah I\\'ve alwaysfelt that that guy\\'s a savant one of themost natural talents here we go here\\'s awave this might be matah could be Shadenright they\\'ve got similar Styles andsimilar approaches to these pipe wavesand uh their stature too you know theygot kind of same body types so wecoloring keep yeah and that too you knowuh definite uh you know similar melanincontent if you will uh got some moreviewers from UK tuning in I I don\\'t knowwhat time is it over there man it\\'sprobably like the next day it\\'s probablytomorrow already right dedicated righton Joe thank you for tuning in from theUK and uhwe\\'ve got a North Carolina viewer is 42degrees over there as we watched thatwas Shaden picaro squeak out of a pipeBarrel so it\\'s a late night in UK 10:40p.m. is what the word we\\'re getting fromour our great crew here Jamie O\\'Brien atback door just gets a little washed outtowards the end all that turbulence fromthe wave prior just uh giving a kind ofa whitewash wipe outhe was close to coming out of thatthough uh yeah Richard Blaine in NorthCarolina kindly says I\\'m hating you guysright now it\\'s 42 degrees blowing Galesand uh it was cold last week was like 62over I know man it was like 67 I wasgetting my sweatpantsout but we know that um we\\'re very luckyand blessed you know like we were sayinguh with cliff and makur earlier you knowI nobody gets to choose where they\\'reborn that\\'s one that\\'s one thing that\\'stotally out of your control and uh youknow being born in Hawaii or or beingable to you know to come here it\\'s it\\'sum truly uh a very very lucky thing anda blessed uh existence so we\\'re verythankful and like to share all that wecan and encourage you guys to come andhang out with us and see us uh you knowsee how we we live and do the thingsthat we get to do it\\'s uh fun to sharefor sure I was saying earlier as look atthis drone shot how like this concept ofAA extends out to the ocean and it\\'sit\\'s it\\'s something that is integratedto integral into that space so this wassomething that when some of the first exWestern explorers came to the islands uhCaptain Cook and his crew and some ofthe that wrote they were just blown awaywith howcomfortable Islanders especially here inHawaii were in the surf uh in fact theysaid in one place they they were theywere just blown away that there was abeach break where there were like over ahundred people in in this shore breakthat uh just looked really scary andtreacherous it was like these in fact hesaid like these humans are kind of likeamphibious like yeah they they don\\'treally have a distinction between livingin the water and outside of the waterand I think you know the Surfers todaythe surf culture and and our communityhere today it\\'s sort of similar right weum you you see guys out there that seemreally Fearless surfing these waves andum so it\\'s really cool that that aspectof of Hawaiian culture is is part of thesurfing story that we have here todayjust that uh concept of not seeing theocean as something to be a divide or orseparate from your experience orsomething that you\\'re afraid of butsomething that you respect and is a partof your culture and community and sovery much so that\\'s been uh a anattribute a cultural trait that we\\'vehad here for many many generations yeahyou know um those early explorers I\\'msure were justmarveling at you know where they wouldcome from it was like don\\'t go towardsthe waves get away from those dangerousthings and you come and see theseHawaiians just looking effortless andcomfortable on whether it\\'s body surfinga a certain size surfboard a liia a pipobig Olo you know like it is um really acool thing to imagine putting yourselfback in that time and uh and not onlybeing a Hawaiian enjoying that but alsobeing like a fly on the boat to just seethe the expression on these explorersfaces when they were watching and seewhat they were like seeing it was likethey could not believe it it was U uhjust a cool thing to think about of howamazed they probably were but it\\'ssomething that you have to be raised inright so corre like Eddie I call there\\'sa lot of stories of him rescuing peopleon the NorthShore many many hundreds ofpeople that he rescued a lot of them hesaid were servicemen people in themilitary that would come here and you\\'dsee some of these younger kids or localpeople like making it look really easylike our Hawaiian water Patrol thetiming knowing when to go out when toslow down when to do what when to gounder the wave that\\'s all stuff that\\'syou know you have to be raised in it uhand so if you\\'re not raised come secondnature yeah you have you know you dowant to be careful and mindful becauselike in Eddie ia\\'s career as a lifeguardhe often would have to rescue peoplethat just maybe were looking at localsand how comfortable they looked in thewater uh but they themselves didn\\'t havethat knowledge in fact uh we\\'recelebrating at this event DukeKahanamoku Duke Pawa Kahanamoku born in1890 and uh in Honolulu in the Kingdomof hoi at the age of 3 years old hemoved over to his mom\\'s property fromHonolulu not too far awaykind right front of Hilton HawaiianVillage that area there right correct umand said that you know these guys likethe Kahanamoku they learned to swim inmany ways in many times before they evenlearn to walk right I mean that\\'ssomething that\\'s a legend of one of youknow hoy\\'s most famous King KingKamehameha the first was raised by achief named niol and niol said he taughthim to swim before he taught him to walkthat is so amazing and uh quite fittingfor you know in what our culture uhlikes to practice today and speaking ofDuke we have a um canila Chang chimingin from New England so way over there onthe east coast and her uhgreat-grandfather was a beach boy withDuke so that\\'s pretty cool uh connectionto uh to Hawaii and um you know I I hopeyou\\'redoing well in New England I\\'m sure umyouknow coming back to Hawaii when when youcan and Darren Collins in Fresno thankyou for tuning in and uh we love sharingwith you guys and uh now um with Beachfrom Spain we got a we got a you arefrom Spain that\\'s so cool awesome yeahBeach Boys uh we\\'re not talking aboutthe the California uh musical group TheBeach Boys although those were fun tooum but W Beach Boys in Wii is reallythat generation of duke duke koku hisbrothers and cousins and friends andthose guys were so awesome and uh we\\'regoing to check out with just a fewminutes remaining in this heat some ofthe highlights we see Kaa Smith doingwell pumping through a pipe Barrel JamieO\\'Brien one of the most dynamic pipelineSurfers uh on that wave right there andwas able to nicely position himselfperfectly not the biggest wave butreally good technical placement thereright we had Shaden pararo on this onenice Barrel bigger wave and right behindhim was matah J from Tahiti oh y yeahand matah got anotherone and so this heat has been uh reallyproductive yeah for these guys um andwe\\'ve got uh questions coming in fromIrelanduh how far back do records go of Surfinggosh wow that that\\'s a great question umwhen we talking written recordsand you know like I mentioned earlierthat Hawaiian Society didn\\'t have awritten language until you know tillafter um you know westerners arrived andinterestingly Hawaii became one of themost literate Society so in other wordsonce reading and writing became a thingin Hawaii uh almost everyone learned howto read and a lot of that was becausethe Chiefs really wanted to promote itand but written records we you know weknow that the first westerners came toHawaii in 17781779 uh they wrote about it but you knowas as a as a scholar of of Hoy and as anative scholar I you know we we got tobe careful to to privilegeoverprivileged written text because mostof our our culture and our history comesfrom oral traditions and those Trace usway back hundreds of years back oh lookat this one what he couldn\\'t get intothat one just about two minutesremaining and uh I know you guys havebeen checking out theoi.com their shirtsand posters and stuff these hats thoughthey are limited edition right and Idon\\'t think that they are for sale Ihaven\\'t known them to be uh prior tobut uh Darren had a question of you knowwhen are the hats going to be availableand um to answer that and short I\\'m notsure if they\\'re going to be thesecollector items right here as we watchJamie O\\'Brien with a little picture inpicture frame me and Isaiah Rocky CannonIsaiah Walker giving you guys playbyplay for this heat number two also gotCliff Bello Ezra rodrig makur Rothmanjumped in for a bit I know he\\'spreparing for a heat later today sowe\\'ll see if uh he\\'ll join us again butuh we\\'re enjoying bringing you that wasall this action that was an amazing waveand just you know the subtle umvariations to tube riding you see guyslike Jamie O\\'Brien where on this one seelook he doesn\\'t grab the rail he choosesnot to wow he was deep that straight onangle was really the true perspective ofhow deep he was he was disappeared for agood while and and you know judges whoare Savvy which are judges of course areuh will pick up on those subtledifferences because not grabbing the readds to the difficulty level y whichshould increase the score as well yeahthose nuances that uh to the untrainedeye can be missed or overlooked quiteeasily but we\\'ve got Barton Lynch FlynnNovak love hodell joseon tail all veryaccomplished Northshore and inparticular pipeline Surfers they knowthey know what they\\'re lookingat well that was an amazing heat yeahthat was a you know good followup toteam Japan A New Earth Project puttingin some good scores uh up next will beour Brazilian team na they\\'ll be uhhitting the water and uh getting startedvery shortly we\\'re going to take a shortcommercial break and we\\'ll be back withmore the hoie backdoor shootout as

stellar heat he had likethree good waves in that heat yeah um avariety of different techniques fromdragging pig dog stalling grabbing railto that last one he just had where hedid the no grab that was impr came outright before the sandar imploded and uhand broke on him but uh we\\'re seeingRocky we\\'re seeing the waves improvethroughout the day just as forecasted bySurfline so we have the chance to umwatch it before our very eyes and that\\'ssomething cool about the motore is thatyou can see the the waves rise and rightbefore your eyes so this SW is supposedto peak tonight and uh it\\'s been it\\'sbeen you know improving we saw that lastHeat with the new Earth Project um lotof waves ridden and a lot of good waveskeeper scores and um so we\\'re glad to behere today it\\'s beautiful Hawai and umwho\\'s up in our next seat rock well it\\'steam Na and it\\'s Bruno Santos had a goodshowing at the van pipe Masters lastmonth G JohanPeter Ian Goa Kona Oliva and LucasSilva right on yeah definitely we haveum you know a mixture of localBrazilians and also Brazilians fromBrazil here we have a riderup beautiful ride also got uh someviewers right down the road inwua and um you know wants to uh keep usuh aware andinformed of uh all of the um differentthings that are being being used informs of chemicals on your food so makesure you guys are well aware read yourlabels and uh just be cautious out therethank you uh Thomas appreciate it nothere was a question earlier I don\\'tthink I sufficiently answered it yet itwas like how far back so how far back isuh surfing uh traced or you know uhwe\\'ll get the specific here is fromIreland is U what are some of theearliest stories of Surfing or how farback did the records go right andthere\\'s been a lot of um interestingtheorizing of this and and more and morewe\\'re seeing that we we have someScholars that are showing that there\\'sevidence of people riding waves in uh incountries in Africa along the coastthere uh in Peru and a Vari other placeshere we have a replay of that one justgot under thecurtain of I think that was IanGoa back doors look like konor Ola andthat\\'s Konacorrect so we\\'ll try to get IDs on theseguys some of the names uhare um I have I have not met G JohanPeter um like I said I\\'ve seen Bruno uhin the previous Vance pipe Masters Iango has been around for a while he\\'s ason of the Brazilian surf Legend Fabiogo oh wow yeah and then Kor Olivaactually lives born and raisedNorthshore with Brazilian Roots uh andties his his dad um Caesar and I believehe\\'s also our uh sponsor guts Hawaiium has been here for decades and one ofthe first uh Brazilian um migrants thatset up shop here in Hawaii on the NorthShore has been uh doing great ever sinceand um Kona now I remember when he wasjust a little boy and uh he grown into afine young man right Lucas SVA we\\'veseen him competing on the world surfLeague stage uh for the last severalyears uh the regular footer Lucas inthis heat as well right um so so yeahthere\\'s been a lot of uh of otheracademics and Scholars that have beentalking about how surfing um or ridingwaves I should say existed in in a lotof other societies however most of thoseyou know like in Peru for example they\\'dride on these large uh almost likelittle kayaks that were made out ofthese wreaths andreads yeah seen I\\'ve seen pictures ofthose it\\'s pretty wild you know but inin all honesty like in in Old in ancienttimes in Hawaii and throughout Polynesiawe\\'re talking hundreds of not thousandsof years um of riding waves onSpecialized equipment designed forspecific types of waves so we we seeevidence of that um I mean thePolynesians uh or Pacific Islanders umcome from um you know linguists calledthe austronesian uh tracing languagepatterns they say well there peoplerefer to as austronesians cuz theirlanguages are similar goes back to likeancient Taiwan not Chinese Taiwan butnative taiwans that live there beforethe Han Chinese moved out into theseregions and so we\\'re talking thousandsof years ago wow where you had voyagersthat were traveling now to what extentand exact dates of when thoseaustronesian uh the ancestors to theHans were were first riding on surfboardstanding we don\\'t know the exact answerto it we do know that they\\'ve beenriding waves throughout these islands asthey\\'ve made their way from Taiwan outto um you know places like Pap Fiji andinto what sometimes called melanesia andthen spreading out to Samu and Tongawhich is kind of the the Cradle theheart of Polynesia and then throughoutmicro um throughout uh you know maresisTahiti Hawaii altero New Zealand all ofthese placeswere OCC you were inhabited by Oceanopeople that traveled there thousands ofyears earlier on these epic voyages ondoubleh hold canoes and and then thesewere you know the the ancestors to ourSurfers so the these were the were TheOriginators of Surfing and by the timewe get to Hawaii um Hawaiian society andculture is known for really developingit to the next level um reallyspecialized a lot of different types ofboards a lot of different type of waveswe have in our in our um our historiesstories of even the first like uh inHawaii you have these four primarydeities these Gods uh Kane um Lono KUand um kanalo and the you know Lono isone of the first gods that in thoseLegends it talks about him coming toEarth so he could serf um and so we\\'retalking about like the origins ofSurfing it\\'s deeply embedded within ourhistory that goes back hundreds if notthousands of years so it\\'s kind of coolthat it is a very old Sport and like Iwas saying earlier Rocky we\\'re inmakahiki season right now and what thatis is in traditional Hawaiian times thiswas a time period when war was uh wasoutlawed and certain coues or or tabosand laws and restrictions were alsoloosened okay and it was also a time ofcompetition so surfing in ancient Hoywas something that was a social Pastimethat you do for fun but it was also acompetitive Arena where they wouldcompete and even gamble over uh andsometimes there\\'s some stories like thethe story of of II alilo he surfsagainst a guy and they you know they\\'recompeting for for their bones which isbasically their Liv wow here we have arider up oh grabbing the rail nicely andthen just goes over thehandlebars not sure exactly whathappened there he looked solid inposition for uh shaping up for a cleanexit and then all of a sudden I meanthat\\'s that pipe in the barrel I meanthings just go south on a on a dime andhe went right over the handlebarsgymnastics in thebarrel you watch him pretty solid rightthere and then we got the uh front anglehe was fully disappeared when we lookedinto that barrel side angle you couldsee his feet literally hitting the topof the wave the roof or the ceiling ifyou will of that barrel and U just did atumble right over thankfully he\\'s okayand there\\'s uhTeam Mr JJ96712 ohno stacking the Heats with theflorenes I didn\\'t know John John wasgoing to be here and so yeah um he mightbe in place of corRothman who uh got a um scary injuryhitting his face on the reef imaginehaving all three Florence Brothers inyour heat yeah so that was actually athe the lineup for the Vans pipe Mastersit has an adapted format from theshootout format and it was all threeflorenes surfing together as wewatch teamBrazil drop intopipeline na is the team nameNa and uh yeah you know if you go totheoi.com you can check out the eventt-shirts and other merchandise there umthe back door shootout hats however Ithink are going to remain uh just a alimited edition item but I also have alittle uh uh fun logo that I made up andI\\'ve got hats available it\\'s nsogdesigns.com and uh the easy ra the Ewith the zebra is what I came up withlast year and finally have all my stuffavailable uh online but if you need oneof those hats you can get one of thosehats the first time I saw you wearingthat it was at the Eddie commentatingand I it took me a second you know whenyou see like a a license plate and yougot to figure out what it\\'s going to saybut then it didn\\'t take me long I waslike all I had to do is say it out loude zebra a oh yeah you B but the fun partpart about it is it\\'s not totally likeobvious right off the bat you know evenfor because it\\'s a pigeon phrase so evenfor us fluent pigeon speakers it\\'s stilllike okay wait I got to figure this outI got so many comments uh but anyway umwe uh do have those hats available andwe have theoi.com obviously is where youget all your back door shootout gear ohmy go and then there\\'s the lineup forthe nextt 96712 that is our postal ZIPcode for this entire coastline like wesaid earlier if you live in haliva bythe boat harbor it\\'s 96712 if you livepuka way over there it\\'s96712 if you live over here by Ted\\'sBakery in VLAN where I live it\\'s still96712 it\\'s got to be the one of thelongest stretched out zip codesoh awesome we\\'ve got a lot of that youknow in this island culture with youknow very veryextended coverage of areas per zip codewell send us some question questions uhwe got a couple so far yeah it\\'s nsogHawaii Gmail nsog Hawaii gmail.com I gota question about sharks uh you knowhaving to clear the water at pipebecause of sharks like you would at jbayor something and fortunately they don\\'tgenerally seem to come in this areawe\\'re going to knock on wood for thatbut um you know I think the craziestthing I seen was a picture of thehumpback whale and her calf kind ofriding in a second Reef pipe W whereit\\'s deeper but other than that you knowum I think the animals kind of know thisplace is dangerous you never hard seeany Turtles cruising out here you don\\'tsee any like dolphins coming throughHawaiian monk seal I saw one the otheruh two nights ago paddling my my mycanoe at cavella Bay I took my daughtersand their friends out and this juvenileseal came right next to the boat it waspretty cool kind of stuck his head uplooked at us and was like hey what areyou guys doingyeah um that\\'s an interesting point yetus humans are dumb enough to try andsurf on here the animals nobetter I mean i\\' I\\'ve definitely I\\'veseen sharks on the NorthShore now thatyou you say this though it\\'s it\\'s it\\'sit\\'s interesting because you\\'re right II\\'ve never seen one at pipe I have seenat Rocky Point which is not too far awayyeah you get them you know coming inlike near White May Bay you know downthe coast lania K chun\\'s Reef you knowwe\\'ve had some encounters there therecloser you get toiv yeah that that deepChannel The Boat Harbor kind ofuh little bit more of a um hot spot forseeing those guys but you know they\\'repart of our ecosystem they\\'re we\\'re intheir world when we get in there and umdefinitely need those animals and theywere quite revered in Hawaiian cultureright I mean in you know in Hawaii wehave what\\'s called alua and we sometimesget a little you know we romanticize themono or the shark everybody want be likeoh that\\'s my alak yeah that\\'s like yeahI don\\'t want to be the gecko what areyou talking about I want to be the sharkso alaku are basically kind of likeSpirit of deities that um in animal formyeah yes that that you see as sort of aprotector for you and interestingly it\\'snot like generally all sharks oftentimes or or all turtles or whatever itis your Alma cool but often times itcould be a specific one okay that wouldkind of be known to fall interestingly II thought of the of the concept of alokanot just when you\\'re talking but lookingat this heat there\\'s a guy named Joseangel in here um and I I\\'m not too sureif he\\'s related to the Jose angel fromfrom our from our surf history past butum there\\'s a story that that Clyde IAtells on I think it\\'s it\\'s published inum Stuart Hol Stuart Holm Coleman\\'s bookon Eddie iow in the in the end of thestory is is basically when when um ClydeIO wins the first Eddie IO event heattributes it to these Turtles and hesays one of them was Jose Angel and theother Turtle he felt were was Eddie IAso like that concept of of um you knowit\\'s a what you call that U these uh HPthis morphic you know like the these inh culture you have anthropomorphic isthe term where like you know animals canalso take on kind ofhuman spirit in kind of like a cosmicsort of way and it\\'s interesting becauseClyde IA says that he saw these twoturtles and he felt like they werecalling him said come sit by me comeover here and he said the turtles wereway out past the boil and outside thepeak he said sure enough the wave of theday came to him and he caught it rightthere by those turtles so you knowthat\\'s interesting cuz it um it may seemkind of hokey to some but you know thatconnection connection that you have uhyou know with nature and look at thisBarrel somebody\\'s connecting with naturethere yeah uh but but it is somethingthat still is applicable today thatpeople draw you know Mana from that theyuh interpret um lived experience throughand I think it\\'s really cool that Clydedid that here\\'s a replay of that oneyeah that\\'s a nice back door positioninggood line being drawn but just the waveracing away was the only prevention ofthat Surfer not able to come out nalomados is uh posing a question is theback door shootout the replacement ofthe old school Duke Kahanamoku surfingclassic from Maui thank younalu and not necessarily um I know theDuke classic was held at Sunset Beach uhand was more of your traditional formatof uh surfing and advancement uhelimination style format uh but we do uhhonor Duke Kahanamoku himself uh in thename of this event you know as in amemory of so we will be talking quite abit about Duke and his um Legacyobviously uh we\\'ve got the Duke\\'s oceanFest during the summertime but this is anice time in Winter where we get to talkabout you know the the Kahanamoku Legacyand what Duke uh has done for surfingand for Hawaii in general um and uhSouth Carolina tuning in brother Joeright on on the East Coast time thereanduh got a shout out from Tyler to Bennyon a new babyboy uhand what is the which of the threeFlorence Brothers grows the meanestbeard well you know we got to line themall up and look but I\\'d say uh you knowuh Ivan\\'s got a pretty good one goingright now has had one yeah and he\\'s theyoungest so um one know Hawaii firstsettled is one evidence they stopped atother Islands Tahiti and all that umKyle from Toronto is tuning in 33degrees in the water wooo that isfreezing my friend I give you cold waterSurfers so muchprops andum and um got some orders coming in onmy my nsog designs you guys I appreciatethat so much uh we I I was reading to mydaughter Z is for zebra I got to the endof the book and I\\'m like oh this wherethe inspiration yeah I\\'m like there\\'ssomething there and I kept repeating itZebra z is for zebra zebra and I go andmy daughter\\'s looking at me she\\'s likefour years old she\\'s like Dad what areyou doing and I\\'m like hold on honey yousee you\\'re seeing the gears turningright now yeah and then I I go oh I\\'llput a e in front of the zebra and thenthat\\'s like I drew it on my cross wordpuzzle book and then it I sent I sent apicture of it to like cliff and kavikasome my the boys that kind of Bouncestuff off of and like what do you thinkof this they\\'re like oh that\\'s prettyhilarious so that\\'s where it was bornbut we\\'ve got um a lot of questionscoming in um the book uh that wasmentioned Eddie is waves of resistanceby Isaiah walker uh that\\'s that\\'s areally uh good read um you know it\\'s uhhistorical good stories um and uh wavesof resistance is what it\\'s called youcan find it on Amazon uh you check itout there or any other you know booksyou find online and we got anotherIreland uh viewer and um you know topfive water watermen or women uh you knowobviously Duke has to be up theresomewhere Duke and Eddie are like ourtwo huge uhwell-known icons world famous iconsWaterman um you know I got to put uh youknow the kolas up there um you knowUncle buff you know and even um ourNorth Shore\\'s own unle ter yoi uhdefinitely you know when we see thewater Patrol we talk a little bit aboutthat uh and we talk about you know thethe improvements of Surfing and uh theancient times and you said the equipmentHawaiians are making or we\\'re justgetting better and better the knowledgeof the Waves right it\\'s so cool to seeHawaiians to this day like in morerecent times like in the 80s right usingthe jety and inventing those techniquesand having that boogie board on the backas you know way to uh serve as kind ofthe you know the the connection from theski to the water because it\\'s not likeyou can pull somebody up onto the seatespecially if they\\'re unconscious yeahyou need some kind of a stretcher or youknow platform to Stage that so thatcontraption that you\\'re seeing rightthere the jet ski with that rescue sledand all those handles was uh Hawaiianagain still inventing and innovatingit\\'s so awesome yeah for sure I meanTerry aoui and Brian kolana uh kind ofknown asthe and others that just they startedoff with just like a bully board if youdon\\'t know it\\'s a Makaha sized boogieboard yeah yeah and then they justrealized like oh if we make this even alittle bigger add these straps on to itand then it became like now it\\'s justit\\'s it\\'s the you know it\\'s the textbookliterally that they teach ocean rescuesafety is that that that style of savingwith the with the sled that came out ofthese guys um training and innovation ontheir own so awesome I mean you\\'retalking about I it\\'s really hard whenpeople say who\\'s the top five you knowthere\\'s so many people but what came tomy mind was real Sun oh yes I mean sureyou\\'re talking about not just skill andtalent but also Community impact yeahbig heart a big in fact a lot of the topSurfers we\\'re seeing today a lot of thembenefited from her her generosity andher support at um like Jamie O\\'Brien uhwas definitely close with anti-il andyou know benefited from the the manyonicontest they did and so you know there\\'sa lot there\\'s a lot of reallyinfluential and impactful Surfers I meanthe ones that we\\'ve mentioned are onesalso that have passed away so oftentimes we memorialize people and they\\'vepassed so guys like Eddie IA um real sonanell who had a battle with cancer formany years right um and these are peoplein our community that are you knowrevered for the commitment of fulfillingI so kulana is a h word that means likeyour stewardship or something that youtake on is like your you knowstewardship I guess is the right wordyeah and I\\'ve heard it defined you knowusing the word responsibility as wellbut I I do like the word stewardship andanti and people like anti and Duke andEddie that\\'s what they embodied was thissense of like giving of themselves tothe community and to the surf communityand to the the the younger generation ofof uh of of Ki or young children and Ithink that\\'s really what in in my mindmakes somebody you know iconic yeahsomebody that is not about themselvesbut somebody that gives of themselves uhwe\\'re seeing David Stant over here ohyeah there\\'s a a great Waterman too he\\'sa big wave charger one of uh you knowthe the founding families right of thehyalu and uh the the um the crew that wehonoring uh with this event and puttingon the hooie back door shootout and theyou know uh we got our uh Pablo fromSpain uh he\\'s asking about surf spots inEurope prior and mentioned mundakaThat\\'s a classic you know really amazingwave I\\'ve never been to the Europeanregion that\\'s definitely on my bucketlist uh if you will but Pablo also askedhow how deep is the The Reef here or howshallow I mean were these waves arebreaking literally you could probablystand and it\\'s about Waist Deep you knowso we\\'re talking three and a half maybefour feet deep uh and when these wavescrash very tall on that shallow of thephysics are not in your favor as theysay um and so that is uh the depth ofwater um I don\\'t know how how deep youwant to get with this Isaiah uh and andgive too much away but uh for you itsays what\\'s your favorite East Sidebreak during a clean East well and likevariable wind so I don\\'t know if there\\'sgoing to be too much um uh um I wouldget lick discover too much mentioningDiamond Head okay so Colin we appreciateit but there are some things we\\'re goingto keep under wraps um and then uh wegot some New Zealand viewers uh Johnnyfrom New Zealand is uh Koto kK and uh it\\'s a Polynesian land ofhavaiki the Hawaiian Islands oh and didthe mai come from Hawaii have there everbeen any kiwi Surfers in this event umas we watch a replay of oh team Braziland just getting lit up right there kindof was at that same spot we mentionedearlier where turtle from North Shoresays when the waves break here don\\'t bethere or you\\'re going to get drilleddrill and that Surfer was right thereyeah it\\'s interesting the term Havioften time so Havi is is a term thatyou\\'ll hear often throughout the Pacificum and it\\'s i h personally and from someof the scholarship that I\\'ve read and soforth it doesn\\'t seem like it\\'s oneplace Havi is often refer look at thisone oh stroking into watch thisbeautiful waveBarrel classic pipeline oh somebody didgo back door stalling for this pullinginto the the barrel oh still going yesnicely done oh wow he gets a niceApplause from the crowd live here on thebeach check it out I think that\\'s Ian goin abeast navigating nicely the wavestarting to pick up you can feel the uhthe swell approaching the little bitlouder crashing of waves the noise therumble is growing look standing up rightthere you asked earlier yeah andfortunately he\\'s way the end here wherethere is a lot of sand yeah so he\\'sstanding on Sand there but it is justthat shallow also when you\\'re over wherethe reef is and that is uh where it getsreally reallydangerous oh look at this one this isthat back door Barr I surprised he cameout of this not to um you know underminebut it looked like he wasn\\'t going tocome out but he somehow manhandles hisway out of this just for like no I\\'m notgoing tofall doggy door so this one this is theGoa wave trying to get deep here butit\\'s bit frothy and frothy is like thathave that foam on the on the surface ofthe water from the previous wave whichmakes it a little more challenging foryour fins or your skegs to engage yeahand your rail too and it\\'s so kind offoamy and you don\\'t you can\\'t really umit\\'s a little morechallenging so it it seems like I if Iwhen I go to the beach announcing mic Imight have to leave my phone for youguys because uh wait I was in the middleof saying we was talking about somethingI cannot remember um you know uh theHavi oh yeah Havi so Havi um is oftenyou know I think it\\'s best answered isHavi is like the homeand and often it\\'slike the place you came from okay so ifyou look at most of the islands you haveplaces that that are similar say HawaiiSai you know Havi these are all similarwords that sometimes people like oh he\\'snamed after this one place but I think ain a lot of the the genealogies Havi isalso just sort of a a Homeland that youcame from um and and is sort ofreferenced as the Homeland that\\'s Ithink that\\'s one of the U I think ananswer but but for sure I mean when wetalk about in in altero New Zealand youhave these Legend of of these canoesthese and there\\'s I believe there\\'sseven of them um seven or nine sorry Iapologize but and they all have namestamui and um they all have these namesof these canoes and that\\'s where kind ofthe ancestors they trace back each ofthose tribes to those canoes um and itis possible it came from Hawaii uhinterestingly you know when you looklinguistically at languages um somePacific Islands languages are a littlecloser than others yeah so like reallyHawaii and New Zealand cook Island Miium Tahiti has yeah there yeah there\\'s alot moresimilarities uh in those languages likein Hawaii we you know there\\'s acommunity uh in nio and they they stillspeak Hawaiian like in a dialect that\\'sreally fast okay and they use a lot ofT\\'s and they pronounce it some peoplesay like I\\'ve had people from friendsfrom Cook Islands uh and from to be likewow those people I can actuallyunderstand them okay um so so yeahinterestingly even though Hawaii and andNew Zealand are some of the furthestIslands apart from each other culturallyand linguistically are quite similaryeah I noticed that when I went therethere are so many similarities check outthat grab rail technique Ian Goa at backdoor with 4 minutes 20 seconds remainingfor team Brazil teamNa and putting a a nice score on theboard for his team so I like thisconcept of you have your individualeffort and your individual Awards youknow we\\'ll be awarding the topfour uh at the end of the event with anawardceremony but also have the team conceptand the points that you\\'re gathering foryour team are uh what you\\'re trying todo is uh not only get some waves foryourself CU surfing I call it the mostnarcissistic sport in existence I meanthere\\'s no other sport where it is youknow all about you uh when you\\'re outeven just in the a regular recreationalsession it\\'s like how many waves can Icatch you know I\\'ve got a 1 hour breakor whatever I got to get mine and it\\'sjust naturally has this really me me mekind of uh approach um and this eventobviously has that part of it where youyou\\'re getting your own scores but thefact that you\\'re adding your scorestogether as a team uh also is a littlebit different than what we\\'re used towatching yep and we have this next teamsitting there in the channel and uhthose guys could rack up a few pointswith all those florenes and EliOlsen and Jose angel I don\\'t that\\'sinteresting one maybe he\\'s a descendantor a friend just um am seeing that namethere I know uh uh Jose Jose the old theoriginal Jose Angel the surfer from wayback his son Johnny Angel uh still anactive uh Northshore lifeguard okay soJohnny Angel uh been around you know nowfor a while and one of the the veton the NorthShorelifeguard staff oh look at this lookslike cor Ola pig dog slows down come onpump it on the foam ball trying to ohman that was so close what a beautifulshot looking straight in there goodcamera work Jet Ski work Zone media andocean paddler TV just putting uhtogether a really nice broadcast for allof us so we appreciate that very muchand it\\'s so cool to be able to see inthe barrel as you were talking reallykind of made my heart uh skip a littlejust thinking of Larry Haynes who\\'s beendoing this for so many years in 2023 weyou know we lost Larry but Aloha to hisfamily and um he was the best at gettingthose water shots you know the pioneerof that forsure um you know uh having the theartistic eye to get those shots and thenthe physical abilitya lot of times you know even before uhthere was regular use of jet skis he wasswimming for hours uponhours uh I would watch him just inhale aSpam musu while treading water and pounda bottle water and just stay out to getthe shots I mean talk about dedicationpioneering andcommitment and I think I did see a shotof uh Larry\\'s daughter on the beach downthere so we want to definitely uhsay aloha and um good thoughts andmemories of of brotherLarry um yeah so so there are somethingalso to remember too is is that you knowthere wasn\\'t in in throughout the thePacific Islands which Hawaii is a partof um and where our history of surfingreally its birthplace is in the Pacificamongst these people but you know therewasn\\'t just one Voyage you had you knowmultiple uh we have a lot of stories umyou know from Hai LA or um you know manymany others who who who sailed back andforth through throughout the Pacific soyou know they would stay at an islandbut then move like for example recentlyarchaeologists discovered Hawaiianpetroglyphs in Tonga wow um kind of coolI don\\'t remember this a few years backwhen the beach washed away over overhere they found a bunch of petroglyphsin in the in the reef over yeah in TheReef that that was I got to see thoseone day uh working as a lifeguard Iheard they were exposed I wrote the ATVover there and I got to see firsthand itwas uh really send some chills throughyour body of just like you know how oldthat is you know um and just getting aword from uh one of our viewers RubenSanchez in Puerto Rico that Jose Angelanhel Morales is another is a last nameso he\\'s a son of Chay Morales fromPuerto Rico so getting a shot to competehere at the back door shootout and umcool thank you for that piece ofinformation we appreciate that verymuch so that heat has

live from pipeline we are herein the vul house looking out over thislenai uh these beautiful waves arewatching a rising swell just as surfline has forecasted we\\'re seeing someawesome surfing right now in our teamsdivision we\\'re right now in the water wehave team96712 which is a zip code I don\\'t knowif it\\'s a Florence zip code specificallycuz there\\'s three Florence Brothers inhere I\\'m Dr Isaiah Walker here withEzra we\\'re stoked to be here with youcheck that out 96712 Eli Olen who iskind of I guess like an adopted Florencechild yep Ivan Florence John FlorenceNate Florence Jose aAngel um who is also I guessMoren sound cliche but they are aNorthshore click these guys came fromgroms and now they\\'re a generation oftheir own and what a heavy hitter teamum Co Rothman was in this but uh he gotuh previously on that last swell he\\'sstill having a little bit of dizzy spellso it\\'s the most safe because you knowhere in you know you can be gun hole gunshy but you know Co is a smart enoughathlete to know when he\\'s not 100% andthat kid charges like a beast so forsure at that beautiful Drone footageyeah as you can see it\\'s a littleovercast today which is nice uh and wegot right in the background there youhave a CA point which is the furthestWestern tip of the island of Wahu andwe\\'re spanning around here seeing aukaiBeach Park this is where we\\'re at hereon the shoreline and as you can see thesand here interestingly rocking wastalking a lot about the sand and how theswells move that sand around you knowit\\'s pretty amazing I don\\'t know of manyother beaches in the world that canchange and shift so quickly within daysyeah within within a period of one swellthat beach will be someplace completelydifferent uh we sometimes have lots ofsand on the beach and even to the pointwhere there\\'s like these ponds y likethese where where the water will come upand form like these ponds of uh in themiddle of the sand and other times wherethe sand is completely gone and thewater is right up under these houses onthe beach so you get the Creeks too theycall it you know all kinds of nicknamesBeaver Creek you know but the beach isdefinitely filling up so come out to theNorth Shore and come join us sobeautiful day here uh at pipeline ifyou\\'re just joining us welcome we are inthe team division this is Heat numberfour of round number one and the formatat the back door shootout is prettyunique in that they\\'re not competingagainst each other they\\'re just tryingto uh ACR uh the best top scores so Ithink it\\'s top three or four wavesdepending on the conditions and as theysurf um through two or three rounds thenat the end the Surfers with the highestpoints um will advance into a final anduh so it\\'s a really cool format it\\'sit\\'s pretty family friendly as you cansee in the heat in the water right nowuh most of them are related to eachother and uh so we\\'re just looking forthe sets to come in to see the florenessplit this peak and and uh get some nicetube rides we\\'ve seen some amazingbarrels in the last few Heats uh in thenew Earth Project heat Jamie O\\'Brien gotthree really good barrels he was on umTeam Japan also G sat two amazing onesoh kenchin Matsunaga got like probablyone of the best way one of the best onesy that\\'s what they were discussingupstairs and then going right into herehere shayen picaro\\'s beautiful leftshayen got a couple good runs as didmatah drle so that I mean we\\'ve seen alot of action that last Heat was alittle slower than some of the othersbut we did see Ian Goa get a barrel onthe left and on the right at back doorKono laa got some good ones we saw allum some Great Waves ridden so here onour sheet Co Rothman isn\\'t surfing inthis heat he is replaced by Mr John JohnFlorence himself right you can see onthe screen there yeah so excitingso I believe John John\\'s the oldest thenNathan is second and Ivan the youngestyou know last year Ivan came reallyclose to winning yeah he did yeah he washe was on fire he was on fire um theFlorence Brothers they\\'re all differentin in they raised together they\\'reBrothers by Blood but they\\'re

with Unclebran serat all kinds of guys I meanlegaciesthem I just hope they get some waves Iknow these guys are frothing at thebit and uh you know team basedcompetition unlike most individualfocused surfing contests the duoibackdor shootout follows a team formatthe Surfers are divided into eight teamstypically representing differentsurfboard brands or local communitiesthis format Fosters a sense ofcamaraderie teamwork and CommunitySpirit among participants but alsoindividually they are surfing in aenvironment that\\'s comfortable for thembut it also gets them comfortable toelevas these Surfers will be surfing likeyou said four to five times right andwhat contest there is no contest like itbecause all the corpocracy and whatnotbut this contest it\\'s just honors thesurfing Heritage the Hawaiian culturemore surfing more of our favoriteathletes getting more bang for theirbuck and they\\'re going for a huge prizepurse right in the next fewdayswell there\\'s still waiting to have a

you know like we\\'ve talkedabout today how there\\'s families andthat seems like certain DNA really fromtheASP his dadWasa Goa yeah and so kind of cool tohave that Legacy of surfers and umpassed down from parent to child uh wewere talking earlier about I mean somany the whole family have a lot of Imean even kala Grace is part of thatwhole family and M um Mason of courseand and others who are in this event Umakoa we saw this morning in thelongboard so it\\'s really cool how we\\'reyou know we do have a lot of of familythat um this event um you knowcelebrates and um be part of thatCommunity Vibe yeah and they definitelyyou know they put in time overhere there you know there was andeveryone\\'s watching so when they getinvited man they\\'re ready to go for surethere was a question earlier uh somebodyasked a question about uh the book wavesof resistance so that\\'s that\\'s a bookthat I published initially it was a myPhD dissertation which already I\\'m suresome people sound bored once I said thatbut um go check it out EV evolved into abook that was published uh by uh pressand one of the questions was like whatwere some of the um key things of thebook I think for for me when whenwriting uh waves of resistance it wasreally about um celebrating surfing butin a historical context so like I saidearlier it really is focused on Historybecause my PhD I got it from UC SantaBarbara in the history Department thereand it was interesting because um weknow when I would explain to people whatmy final a dissertation is basicallyyour final project that\\'s like a 3 to500 page paper basically and um I wouldI would explain to people that I waswriting about Hawaiian surfing and youyou\\'d often get like the raised eyebrowyou know like oh is that really is thatreally an academic topic um but I wasreally it is yeah so it was kind of myum Mission I suppose to to prove thatyou could uh really make somethingacademic out of of Surfing becausethere\\'s so much culture and history uhto celebrate and to to analyze so and Ialso wanted to clarify that because I II personally you know was able toIdentify some some inaccuracies in someof the previous work that had been doneand um so for example a lot of timesthere were some some ideas that wereproped that like surfing died in Hawaiiand at the end of the in 19 1800s uh andthen it was later resurrected by a guynamed Alexander Hume Ford and that Imean it was it was simply incorrect likeI knew that guys like you know PrinceJonah kuo and his brothers David andEdward were surfing m not only in Hawaiiat that time when it was supposedlyextinct but also in like Santa Cruz toall the you know the hoopla around ityou your book writes the story and sothat was one of the motivating factorsfor me was to to um do a better jobhistorically uh of presenting uh thestory of of surfing in Hawaii in a waythat um could break through some ofthose myths because a lot of those mythsalso kind of contributed to a more anarrative that wasn\\'t so favorable toHawaiian um the idea of hawaian sortof you know becoming extinct so to speakwhich I knew wasn\\'t correct um and so byyou know in in my book I like tocelebrate uh Surfers that were lessknown uh guys like koho who was surfingthe NorthShore the same time as Gregnull but we you know we knew more aboutGreg null than guys like koho and othersum and then of course getting intotalking about duk Hanam moku and and andand many others but but yeah so that toanswer the question um that was some ofthe uh you know waves of resistance someof the key themes was just trying tocelebrate uh the history of surfing uhthe history of Hawaii and also to makesure to clarify some of themisconceptions that were being promotedthat I knew were you know in inaccurateand so so anyway a lot of inaccuracy andthat\\'s why I love waves of resistanceyour book puts it into perspective thereal truth you know there\\'s a lot ofstuff going on in the surf industry youknow try to mimic and recreate what isreal before the cell phone era you knowso uh yeah you know don\\'t get fooled youguys know what is what and these guyshave been uh sitting so far right and uhthe whole Beach is excited to watchthese guys go yeah that\\'s theinteresting thing about the ocean youknow it\\'s just mhm and they say this alot of about pipeline in particular thatpipeline chooses thesurfer and I think we\\'ve seen that uhmany different um years over the yearshere at the back door shootout um youknow we\\'ve had standouts whereindividuals the wave just came to themone that comes to mind of course ktomakatoka who caught like a 12-point ridethis was a few years back just a heavyheavy wave that came right to him uhWe\\'ve also seen Moana Jones last yearthe wave that they came to tourunfortunately it was like seconds afterthe horn blew MH um well of course CoRothman had I think he had one of thewaves of the day of the event last yearso it\\'s interesting how like you knowthere\\'s not much you can do if the oceanis not coming rush her but shedefinitely rushes us to get to her youknow what I\\'msaying yeah so wow three teams alreadybeen in their first round team JapanTeam new Earth Project and team Na andnow you\\'re uh watching96712 and that is the local Northshoreboys and then coming up following themwould be snapped five so Eli Olen out inthe water with Ivan Florence John JohnFlorence Jose Angel and Nate FlorenceNate was very entertaining um this yearwinning Surfer of the year but alsotaking us around the world with hisGoPro right and we were getting barreledat where he was getting barel and that\\'ssomething that we\\'re offering throughthe ocean paddler if any Surfer orathlete here we go rer up grabbing railslowing down getting in thetube that is Eli Olen Eli with a kickflip at theend MrOlen this guy had a killer wave umearlier on in the season he also chargedinto a heavy one after his Heat at theat the Eddie IA big wave Invitationalbut it didn\\'t count but he had a massiveone here we go beautiful backsidetechnique drags his arm his knee and hisbutt the three-prong drag and he hitsthe E jabutton but plenty time left in the heat1505 remaining yeah I\\'m wondering ifmaybe the tide is playing into theselows right now cuz it\\'s all the guysfrom over here say there\\'s that 35 to 45I\\'ll give it 48 minute lws at times andthen packs of waves come inso we\\'ll see what happens as they\\'regetting intoposition beautiful nothing out the backbut there are a couple little dark bluePacific ribs out the back but we\\'ll seeif those things generate as they moveyards towards our surface they suresitting comy and cozy next to each otheroh yeah they\\'re they\\'re Brothers butwait till the waves come in we\\'ll seewho gets the choice of waves because inthis amazing cultural event in theformat there is no priority well youwonder too is that you know they knowthe wave so good that they have theirexact spot that they say and they\\'re allin the same spot the same spot and thenwhoever goes into that you know they\\'rejust going to they\\'re right on that holetheir favorite they know their favoritesitting spot they know which ones to getTeam snap last year\\'s Champions clayBenji the the single champion of theshort oh yeah mon family Legacy gettingcoached here by Makmakua oh my goodness Northshore boysthird to the last Heat of the firstround and he\\'ll be coming up I see makurotman waxing up his board he preparesearlydang sort of reminds me I mean we uhRocky likes to make some references tothat movie Northshore yeah if the waveshere don\\'t be there but this alsoreminds me that final scene in inNorthshore when the they\\'re out there inthe water and the the ocean goes flatright and then there\\'s no ways and thenright at the end the wave comes and yougot the leash pull oh yeah with Lancebur lard Hamilton you know it it doesn\\'tmatter how many times we watch thatmovie it\\'s a classic here we go turnaround Rick yep turn around Rick you\\'regoing to pull in on a shortboard butkick out Goofy foot on a longboard therewe go oh is this a Florencebrother beautiful and guess what he\\'sgot a GoPro in his mouth I\\'m not sure ifit\\'s one of our GoPros but each Surferis asked if they want to have a GoPro intheir mouth we can switch live rightinto their live Barrel which I\\'ve beentalking to Jakemaky um right that\\'s you know um Jakemaky is definitely game I was talking tohim he\\'s like wow he\\'s sweeping thesteps saying that\\'s pretty good I Roywant to do that let\\'s watch this replayand this is Nathan Florence slows downpulls into the barrel deep comes outclean seamless notuntouched nice narrow stance nice CrouchNathan Florence man yeah and I thinkmost of these guys these days a lot ofthem have their own like YouTubechannels where you can watch this that\\'shis ownGoPro I know him and Cole Roth V havetheirown yeah Nate amazing Year brothercongratulations on everything I saw avideo of them way out at Himalayas justcharging those some of the bigger swellsthat came early thisseason mad talented man that guy\\'salways pondering his next move and he\\'safrothy frothy guy just huntingbarrels so that was a beautiful score ontheboard as as you guys know in the backdoor shootout we aim to please four tofive times these Surfers will surfduring our waiting period and we\\'ll bepicking it apart along with our amazingjudging panel Barton Lynch Flynn NovakJoelsent and love hodell are you kidding meguys those guys could win theevent so far uh in this heat we justhave Nate and Eli with scores butthey\\'re decent scores yeah awesomebut yeah pretty uh slow start to thisheat unfortunately and know this isprobably highly anticipated with theSurfers that in thewater on the next Heat to has some starstudded Surfers on that roster rainingchamp snap to with the champion Benjibran very exciting Benji originally fromSouth Africa but has lived in Hawaii formany years since he was a teenager Ibelieve and um man he just he he has a arelationship with pipe that I mean isdefinitely really cool if you watch someof the snap movies I mean that guy didyou see his Barrel the other day at backdoor Mini Snapper Rock I mean that therewas more like that too I didn\\'t see allso amazing how he\\'s like slipping downthe face even Seth mon had a similar onehe had the airdrop it was just bar likedisengaged from his board and somehowengag but made it that far like theseguys traveled football fields Billy andMaka Rothman the other day just and youhave to have like nerves of Steel tolike cuz you have to think like allright there there\\'s like thousands ofpounds of water that\\'s about toannihilate me but I\\'m just going tofocus on what\\'s in front of me while myfins are out of the water I got to thinkokay I got to reengage this and then theSplit Second and if you\\'re you know ifyou even stop to question or to ponderof what\\'s about to annihilate you youknow most humans would just that wouldbe enough to want to eject hit the ejectbutton but they it look so easy so coolto watch the confidence in Surf ofsurfers like our competitors here todaythat are able to just finish finish thejob of making that drop and bottomturning right before the heaviest rightbefore and then traveling all thoseyards through the tube you know there\\'suh ribs inside there little creases thatthey negotiate they goo toe to heel Edgereal sensitive stuff tube ridingis I mean these guys come off the bottomand just you know what like for thegoofy Footers I really love that deepbottom turn like Tommy Carol and as theyhook it up underneath the lip we seensome of our longboarders earlier todaythey had that time cuz they get in earlythey come up off the bottom and they getto do a little turn underneath the lipbut they got to set up that 9ot rail soI mean and it it is death defying tooright like we see Brazilian Surfercalled chumino U you know hit his headknocked out and had to be revived on thebeacho is still recovering uh so I meanit\\'s it\\'s a real deal it\\'s prettyserious and so these athletes are arewarriors big time and if you guys don\\'tknow what the n96712 is that\\'s the NorthShore area codesimilar to mine in Ina96821 all right I think I said that whenI introduced them at the ceremony andhad to do a quick real switch with thenumbers super numbers but y these boysare frothing 967 17 in haahwn and you know These Guys these guysyou know they surf it all they cangravel one foot slop and they can go allthe way to 25 ft easy I mean look atthat sand Bank there it\\'s just I wantedto talk to you about it how\\'s the layoutof the beach how\\'s the fullon Nook rightover there by gumballs right that issome stuff and as we get biggerwestwells it\\'ll push that out and you\\'llget you know you won\\'t get that sandarsection that closes out somuch and we\\'ve already I think we\\'vealready kind of seen it move a bit todayas the waves been coming upit\\'s going to be day three we\\'re goingto look off the balcony and that littleNook is going to be goneright all right here we go let\\'s see ifwe got any Surfers going for thiswave well you can see some lines outthere but this heat has been slow Ithink probably the tide has something todo with it cuz it\\'s it\\'s changing it\\'sbottomed out at low tide and uh as thetide comes up usually you get like thishigh tide push they sometimes call itwhere it comes in with the with theincomingswell so hopefully we\\'ll see that happensoon CU there\\'s only 6 minutes and 15seconds left in this heat yeah MahaloJeff and the guys at Surf Line crew Iknow me and you work together withbrother Jeff at the the magnitude rightand uh that\\'s awesome stuff hopefullythey get some real big swells so wecould do that again this winter and yeahocean paddler TV man you see all thatamazing Drone footage there are thepioneers of that they were the first todo it and that\\'s what we want to dotoday we want to go live as me Rocky orIsaiah or Clifton batell are talkingabout the surfer we can go right intothe barrel with the surfer so you\\'regoing to see that coming up a littlelater it\\'s up to the surfer but

onekind of close out on us but beautifulday yeah I believe the swr\\'s starting tofill in winds are favorable now so theselater rounds uh these later uh Heats Ishould say looks like it\\'s going to besome some uh good surf action bro howwas that last SE team snaap five Sethmon less ankles mon I\\'ve been callingthem and uh that was Seth oh thatbrother was barreled at back door and umlooking forward to the wave\\'s gettingyou know a little more little more cleanuh a little more groomed with the tradeWIS and um having a lot of fun watchingthese guys get barreled the crowd on thebeach they\\'re loving it I know you folkswatching online and on the broadcasthave been chiming in and uh enjoying theaction as well so want to give a shoutout to um you know Jay Lane tuning inand uh when you when you wipe out herethat the water is shallow it\\'s onlyabout 3 to four feet andso that was one of the common questionsthat we\\'ve been getting is like how howshallow really is it and um it\\'s likeI\\'ve been saying the physics are not inyour favor yeah as you mentioned RockySeth was a standout in that last Heatand I think we have pu makay down therewith him on the beach right now allright you got two amazing back doorwaves out there um how are the waves howare you feeling yeah it was um crazylike back toback waves I just had umhonestly wasn\\'t really looking rightbefore that heat I was kind of justwanted a pipe wave and those two waveskind of just came to me was kind ofgifted I feel like uh cuz definitely waslike a slow day and I know the waves aresupposed to get better today so I thinkduring that heat just started turning onawesome yeah this is a historical eventso you know obviously you do a lot ofevents around the world what is specialabout this event and being in it I thinkjust special to be like surfing on ateam format you know it\\'s the only eventthat\\'s kind of like that and to reallyhave that camaraderie out there with theboys you know my brother and then threereally good friends so uh it\\'s just it\\'sjust a really good time it\\'s reallyrelaxing out there awesome and thisevent is in honor of Duke um what impactdoes Duke have on your life and what isone word you would describe him as Imean if it wasn\\'t for him I wouldn\\'t bedoing what I\\'m doing right now so youknow all thanks to him I grew up on thebeach that he taught surfing to everyonethat came to away so it\\'s just like Ifeel like you know I\\'ve spent my earlydays as a little kid learning how tosurf in W ke and kind of just embodyingthat the Duke spirit so yeah definitelycarrying his legacy around the worldawesome thank you good luck in the nextround interview questions from po Theoasking about Duke Hoku asking aboutthose waves oh we got a set on theoutsideoh but yeah I like that he saidinteresting and we were talking aboutthis earlier um Ezra and I that oftentimes and we\\'ve mentioned this manytimes before that pipeline often choosesthe rider and I mean that\\'s Seth said Iwasn\\'t even looking for a back door waveand two of them came to me back to backyeah and and when you hear him speak andhis humbleness I mean so no wonder whywhy it comes to him you know it\\'s likethe wave whisper Kelly Slater has thatability too rightyeah well and um you know Seth has a abig event coming up later this month atthe the yeti Pro Pipeline and you knowhe\\'s one of our world surf LeagueChampionship tour HawaiianRepresentatives correct and um you knowwe talked about the Reps as we watch areplay I think that\\'s Mak Kai I thinkthat\\'s Maka yeah he was up here talkingstory with us earlier andum he was hoping by the time he went outinto his seat the waves would be pickingup a little bit so I think he\\'s gettingwhat he wasbargaining for sure you can see somelines out the back so indication of likethe swell Risinghopefully it has been slowly Risingthroughout the day nothing too dramaticbut it definitely was a lot smaller thismorning during our long board andstandupdivisions yeah I think it all kind ofworked out uh for thebetter uh time of the day for theseshort borders to be out here surfing anduh I think they\\'re very thankful as wellthe swell is making its way to theisland now we got some guys in this heatand the previous few Heats that uh ifanybody couldsurf these waves are these are the onesto do it and you can kind of see themscratching over to try and see if theycan get a look at this wave here but uhnotakers now um you know we\\'ve beencelebrating duah moku at this event andthere\\'s a lot of things that you cancelebrate about his life first of allsurfing of course seen as the father ofmodern daysurfing um and and of course with withOlympics as we see a paddler here holysmokesa it\\'s like Makaimnam no way oh man that that look like aalmost like a guarantee almost you canjust see that water and froth on TheSandbar right there yeah he was he wasparked in thatthing look at his drop just grabbing therail good dragging of theelmu on the backside right there andthen it just foam ball SW oh I don\\'tknow if you man that exit would havebeen tough that was like a three-stepdrop right there yeahdefinitely yeah and you wonder like Iyou don\\'t want to use the word greedybut you sometime we sometimes refer tothat when you\\'re in the barel and you\\'relike I can stand a littlelonger and uh unfortunately he wasn\\'table to come out of that one but I was agood siiz wave for today that was a niceone that was one of the bigger oneswe\\'ve seen so farwell good to see he\\'s okay he\\'s uhsmiling but shaking his head andexplaining to I should have patol ofwhat was going on inthere a lot goes on in there that wecan\\'t see but that camera ski reallygives us a better vantage point to seewhat the Surfers are going through whereyou can see that foam ball just engulfhim yes so I was talking about with Duanmoku we cele there\\'s a lot of things youcan celebrate him uh his life asOlympian or the swimmer you know he\\'s asprinter mostly um and then as a surferbut then the other one also is him as alifesaver rescuer kind of pioneered umyou know working with the Red Cross evenwhere in his time there there weren\\'treally that many like organized skilledlifeguards and they actually hired himthe the Red Cross hired him to travelacross the United States and elsewhereto teach people how to save people umand it\\'s interesting because it\\'s it\\'snot just Duke um uh you have a lot ofother there\\'s a Hawaiian guy thatpreceded Duke he was a little bit olderthan Duke uh his name was George freeand he grew up in Hawaii but then heended up moving to um to HuntingtonBeach and into Southern California andhe started a lot of this ocean rescue umprograms as well so it\\'s really cool Imean we\\'ve been talking earlier Rockyyou and I were talking about how theInnovation with with rescue and lifesaving in modern times is just somethingthat we still see here in Hawaii amongstHawaiian umwatermen um and so I mean I did have aquestion for Cliff cuz Cliff has beendefinitely in the center of of workingwith the Hawaiian water Patrol usuallyyou know you\\'d be out there with theseguys maybe you tell us like a little bitwhat what\\'s going on when you\\'re whenyou\\'re out there with these Surfers umand and on the ski um I we\\'ve seen someI mean last year unfortunately butfortunately we had some rescues thathappened um I mean just just from yourexperience what what\\'s it like being inthe water during these events with thewater Patrol or especially this eventcuz you know we\\'ll see what A\\'s got onthis wave real quick oh yeah so we wethat was aa aa so I I definitely umespecially this event they like to runit in larger surf it is a Surfers eventand the boys want to charge so thisevent you know we\\'re heightened not likewe\\'re not heightened on each event butwhen it gets big like this or bigger andyou know it\\'s pipeline it\\'s the mostdangerous wave in the world and so we\\'rejust on all alert every wave every timea surfer like you see here AA taking offall eyes are on him right now and thenyou\\'re going to look and see whathappened here you\\'re going to see if hekicked out the back if he got poundedand you can kind of recognize a a prettycritical wipe out and then we\\'re goingto respond 100% And we have a grabber onthe back we\\'re all trained uhfor you know we pray we we prepare forthe worst case scenario and we pray forthe best you know awesome you uhdefinitely like kind of always on theedge of your seat because at pipe evenif it doesn\\'t you know looks kind ofroutine but you don\\'t know when that oneis going to be the one where okay he\\'snot coming back up and you know from uhsitting on the jet ski to sitting in theLifeguard Tower it\\'s like you\\'re alwaysjust onedge knowing that any wave could be theone that somebody\\'s not going to comeback up and that\\'s a great point thatRocky makes because it\\'s not always thewave that they\\'re on or riding that theyget hurt on a lot of times it\\'s the nextone or the one after we\\'ve had some thatuh actually were the ones that causedthe the damage and so you you basicallyuntil that person paddles back past youyou\\'re kind of watching to make sureespecially when it gets bigger you knowyeah it\\'s like you\\'re not out of thewoods yet once they paddle past us thenwe can kind of focus on the on the nextthat\\'s a good point because with ColaGrace last year that it wasn\\'t the wavehe was riding it was the ones after sothat\\'s where it kind of for us is likethey paddle past us smiling and talkingabout the wave okay you\\'re you\\'re in asafe spot youknow well there was a a very well-knownincident now um speaking of Duke kahokuand rescuing but here\\'sKai Rothman in thebarrel nicepositioning he just gotcatapulted like a humancball up over that backwash that wascatching air and look seek and you shallfind he just put it in the universe thathe wanted the waves to start turning onright nice technique grabbing the raillooking solid right there gets justunder the hook H gets the feels the spitstraightens out and then this is just ahuge explosion and it looks like he itperfectly and he definitely knows whathe\\'s doing he\\'s jumped away from hisboard right you don\\'t want to be bythose gigs or by anything that\\'s goingto hurt you so he punted right therewhich is verysmart he also jumped a little bit beforethe backwash actually hit so it didn\\'tshoot him 100 feet in theair and so that\\'s what we look for rightthere when we\\'re talking about itsmiling talking to us at the ski yeah mwas in a good spot rightthere uh but the um the rescue that Dukeperformed I think it was in Californiawhen that um fishing boat had capsizedright uh and it was quite a waysoffshore and he had his surfboard andthat was also part of the you know thepioneering or the the use of a surfboardto help rescue people and I think he uhwas able to get almost all of them andthen was like feeling really really badhe couldn\\'t save everybody yeah and um II recommend anybody out there listeninguh to watch that the Waterman yeah filmthe one you invited me to the premiereIsaiah over at BYU Hawaii and that was areally well done documentary about duahHoku yeah really cool and that that thatstory that you\\'re telling that\\'s kind ofthe real poignant part of thedocumentary where it shows um you knowDuke\\'s abilities to uh to to to rescuebut at the same time the hardship thatcomes with not being able to you knowsave everyone and you know there therewere more than 13 people on the boat andthat it capsized and by himself he wentback and forth and rescued um butunfortunately there you know noteveryone survived so the film I thinkdoes a really good job of conveying theemotion that goes into rescue andum yeah and I I could I could see whereyou know even at these events and soforth you have friends that are in thewater putting their lives on the lineand there\\'s an emotional attachmentdefinitely a connection and and not thateach each life the way we react oh wegot a little back door action going hereyeaha little too deep is he coming nodoggy door but uh yeah you know it\\'sit\\'s friends you know you watch theseguys every day Surf and and you\\'rearound them you know some of them havefamilies you knowand it\\'s not that we don\\'t take each andevery person\\'s life serious you know butit\\'s adds a different element when it\\'ssomebody you actually know you know wehad Kanani Chapman one year you knowkala Grace I mean makur has been injuredit just you know you want to put yourbest foot forward for everybody but itjust adds an element when it\\'s friendsyou know for sure yeah y Stewart pullinginto this one it just raced way ahead ofhim and shut down couldn\\'t make thatdoggydoor another deep one that looked likekog race waves are starting to pick upinfiresee now you can see it\\'s a lot differentfrom this drone shot more turbulent alot moremovement than the uh stand up in longthat\\'s not easy also try to duck diveunder some of these yeah huge explodingwaves and uh you know for one there\\'s alot of power in these waves and there\\'snot a lot of room below shallow so thereare times um you know if when I was wassurfing out here regularly and you getcaught inside and you know people a lotof times ask like you open your eyesUnder Water whatever like yeah you knowif there\\'s big waves definitely duckdiving small waves ah close eyes it\\'sokay but when you\\'re when you\\'re surfingwaves like this and a CA Grace getting aclose out right there but you get underand you bail your board and you look andlike the water the wave is tumbling overthe reef and there\\'s nowhere to go soyou\\'re just like flat on the reflinghoping for the best and um you know nothaving a lot of room under there reallyadds to the risk the danger kind of yourstrategy I\\'m you know pretty prettylight skinny guy so I T to I tell getblown up and floated you know not reallyyou know a lot of times driven down tothe reef but I\\'ve been in these waveswhere it\\'s like you fall off and theyfeel like there\\'s no water and you goright through this air pocket and likeoh thankfully nothing uh in my upperextremities but elbows knees shouldersjust smashing into the reefright souh so definitely a degree of danger isuh at a very high level here at Pipelineand uh there weare rocky Canon Cliff botell IsaiahWalker and we thank you guys so much forjoining us online for the podcast uhwe\\'ve been getting a lot of nicecomments uh some good questions comingin at nsog Hawaii at Gmail and we\\'vebeen very fortunate to have greatconditions to start day number onealways good when he can get a first dayright away get going most definitely andand the waves actually start to turn onfor this uhshortboard uh round one really uhimportant for the Surfers to be able toSurf some High Caliber high qualitywaves and so it\\'s perfect Tim here youknow we we\\'re talking about um you knowthe documentaries and so forth I Irecently was a you know blessed to be apart of another documentary on thehistory of the Shaka oh cool and it\\'sgoing to be a real good one it\\'s comingout soon I\\'ve already seen I saw that onthe news yeah yeah that it was comingout and uh looks looks really cool but Imean you know you see in Hawaii a lot ofthe the Shaka that happens and I thefilm does a really good job in tracinglike the origins and also the thevarieties and how it evolves over timeum you know not to spoil it or anythingbut it has you know origins in aHawaiian Waterman from La known as H KHand so he you know back over 100 yearsago he worked on the sugarcaneplantations and lost these three middlefingers okay and then he became I meanhe was kind of like a you know reallyrespected kpuna there in on this side ofthe island and um was a part of the hilawhen before the Polynesian culturecenter they had these this uh hooky loudperformance and so forth and he becamereally kind of popular he\\'s a really bigdude like 65 and they said he would hewould often model as kha in the paradesand stuff but he would wave and he onlyhad those twofingers and so the Shaka was kind ofboring out of that and then it it got alot more popularity as you know overtime with surfing surfing was one of thebig vehicles for dispersing you know theShaka from here on the NorthShore outthroughout the world and then also youhaveum you know some celebrities thatstarted picking up one of the first wasElvis Presley and when he came to Hawaiihe was filming at the PolynesianCultural Center probably got into theyou know the Shaka from the from thekids there who knew you know HKH um and then we see it just kind ofbeing proliferated all around the worldand um so anyway kind of a cooldocumentary to look forward to but umyeah Shaka you see there\\'s a lot inHawaii but interesting the word Shak ishas a sort of a separate history thatcomes in a little later I was going tosay we don\\'t we know about sh yeah yeahyeah in Hawaii language so apparentlythere was a a comedian Hoy that soldcars the name was lipia Spinda and hewould have these car commercials and hewould throw the the the sign of theShaka but he\\'s he was the one sort ofattributed to like naming it that and Iguess uh in these old um Japanese filmsand that would come to Hawai and likewhether it was like Samurai movies orwhatever the there was a Buddha thatcomes out ofJapan called Osaka and so in a lot ofthese movies you\\'d have these guys doinga different sign but saying Osaka anywayI don\\'t want to give it away too muchbut it\\'s a real cool documentary thattraces like where this shakun howinfluential it is but it becomes also asymbol of Aloha you know like so it\\'sit\\'s more than just the sign that Imentioned uh just in my own you know nothaving seen the the uh documentary oranything like that but um that it isbasically uh Aloha in a hand gestureyeah you know um and it\\'s so it\\'samazing you say that Isaiah but howGlobal it\\'s become right and you seelike total like non Hawaii people nonsSurfers somewhere and they\\'re like heyou know like do and then there\\'s youknow as we watchuh side slipping Tail Spin his board wasdoing the shock on yeah um then uh ookala we\\'ve got kala Grace packing one atpipe so that\\'s the angle we talked aboutright there that\\'s pretty killer that isjust right inpipewow wow more wave machine ooo M and adeep one come on let\\'s go no just toodredged on that one yeahthese we on now you know the Shaka hasmade it onto the Emojis you know so Ithing is totally going around the worldt-shirts you see it on t-shirts hats youknow Koozies yeah and it\\'s I\\'ve heardthe term the Hang Loose yeah you knowkind of a acasual it\\'s called the varieties rightofShaka right yeah you get the babyShakaPapayou ever seen somebody sh with theirfeet some people can do them with theirtoes yeah oh it\\'s a replay of ShackAttack getting a shacker oh instead of aShaka look at that oh I think that\\'s M\\'spitch superdeep just got up a little too high inthere what this thei back door shootouthas a lot of shakas but not a lot ofshockers yeah so you don\\'t have to havethat kind of heat whereyou know in a typical elimination heator style event the format where if youget third or fourth you\\'re out of thecontest you could have a 25 minutes ofjust having a bad luck wrong positioningout of place out of syn no Shockers noShockers at the shootout only ShockersonlyShockers definitely a plus for thisevent some people like to shake shakethe sh What You Know reverse outside lor the inside yeah the loose ones thesuper loose yeah the high ones the lowones so 8 minutes 30 seconds for theNorthShore boys there got a couple ofscores that they\\'ll probably uh considerKeepers for today but yeah you know uhin this in this round one uh as we\\'vebeen saying you don\\'t have to get any ofyour scores from any particular roundthey are just added together the bestones uh from whatever day they might bebut if you\\'re were one of the teams likeSnapped where you had Seth Mon and BenjiBrandt you know Seth with the upper handthe back door wave was really you knowthose two waves were uh pretty topnotchum you got to feel pretty good if you\\'regetting those kind of scores today anduh knowing you know tomorrow could beeven better could be bigger the sandmight move a little bit more off ofPipeline and start to open that up uheven more today but um Team Japan gotthat early start you know keninMatsunaga that nice back door long longbarrel so uh there there\\'s been somepretty amazing standout moments y uh andthe teams that were able to find thosecouple of nice really high scores are ina goodspot um I have had a question maybe uhyou could answer so in the next round dothey pick the same way draw out of theHatum they we\\'ve done we\\'ve had seen itdone a couple different ways um to whereyou just reverse the order got it um butalso you know the middle Heats they\\'llstill be surfing at technically the sametime you want to give everybody a chanceto surf at different times of the daybecause we know you know sometimes thevery first heat might be not as good asmaybe the the midm morning heat um andthe different conditions so uh we\\'ll uhsee the flag\\'s really starting to moveright now too that breeeze kicking upthe Tradewind Direction grooming it outnicelyum is uh I\\'ve seen it also picked out ofthe Hat again so just lock of the jawit\\'ll be luck of the draw and uh pickingthe right numbers just picking one righthere H I think that was legend thatlooked like uh LegendChandler his brother Manalo ourlongboard Champion today the young15year old which one\\'solder what who\\'s older who\\'s younger umyou know I think Mana nalu is younger Ithink I I\\'ll have to stand by for aconfirmation on that but uh both verytalented young man for sure young manforsure see he was looking at the barrelbut had the straighten out cuz it wasjust closing out right there on thesandarhe\\'s heading back out celebrating dukHoku at this back door shoot and I lovethat I love that we do that because alot of times you know people just thinkof Duke as a Wy key figure but BR wasfrom hoi and and he would come out hereto the NorthShore rabbit K Kai said thatthey would come and Surf haliva and surfon the NorthShore and um you know sosometimes we assume that he never leftWy when he was surfing but you know ofcourse we know that Duke spread umsurfing throughout the world places likeAustralia and east coast of the UnitedStates and like I said earlier he woulduh went over to California butCalifornia you had um like you knowPrince jonok kuo and Edward and Davidkanana nakoa who years earlier had beensurfing in um in Santa Cruz and thenagain also as I mentioned earlier Georgefree was from wiii moved to umHuntington and surfed there so so so alot of lot of great um history ofsurfing that has roots in you know theseSurfers like Duke aoku went around theworld to share thatAloha but cool that we can celebratehere here at the back door shootout uhcuz Duke love big waves too people don\\'treally talk much about that but here wego k Grace rer up K Grace up gettingbared another nice weave reading by himyeah kala you know we talked aboutearlierthe surfing in general but also you knowkind of magnified at pipeline theultimate high you can be on aftergetting a a wave that is just amazingriding in the barrel being able to comeout and then experiencing the other endof that of just the worst day of yourlife ever getting pounded gettinginjured so last year kala had the veryhorrific scary injury and incident whereuh he smashed his face on the reef Nolankilano was able to jump in and you knowuh pull him out and he was revivedrecovered in the hospital but the yearprior he had that 12-point crazy pipeBarrel during the shootout which youknow a lot of times we said you know inthe same session it could happen buttalk you know a year separated of theultimate getting a 12-point ride duringthe back door shootout I mean there\\'snot many humans that have that uh thathave that claim or that you know youmight have got a great wave some othertime but to do it during the event is sospecial right and to get better than a10 to get a 12 that\\'s even better yeahso and then you know then next very nextyear he\\'s fighting for his life yeah youknow it\\'s just the crazy highs and lowsthat\\'s just this this wave you knowshakas shakas yeah everybody talkingabout it andMagnolia and uh our Mr Zone mediahimself brother Alex thank you so muchgreat production the Drone shots havebeen just outstanding the angles fromthe ski looking into the barrel yeahjust very very one-of-a-kind uh shotsthere so good good job to the team yeahMahal because this this stuff I seen allover the world if you tunein uh andso the technology you got a drone flyingwe got hopefully we get a taker on theGoPro on the helmet but that\\'ll be Ithink everybody\\'s just kind of gettingtheir uh their feet wet you know feelingit out for this year\\'s shootout maybe inthe later rounds we could have anopportunity whereum you know hey TR me some uh PocketChange P there TR to get one for youguys you know surfing with a clearlineup is

beautifulvision and looking into the crystalball and able touh thread through that pipe wave andmake itout verynicely looked into the crystal ball Ilikethat oh yeah that what was that two orthree years ago when they had that heatand it was just on fire just nonstop itwas like pumping it was you know kind ofaverage it was okay leading up to it andtheir heat I mean it\\'s like uh we talkedabout it earlier of how quick theconditions can change uh you know ForBetter or For Worse in some cases but inthis case man it went from like oh it\\'sokay you know there\\'s a couple to likeevery wave every set left right leftright I mean I think they racked uplike 10 or 12 excellent scores in a spanof like 20 minutes it was pretty one ofthe most memorable quality pipe Heatsthat we\\'ve seen covetedyeah oh Somebody went back door too onthis set yeah one of our uh Peruviancompetitors that might have been uhGabrielvillon yeah this event has some greatmemorable historic um highlights andseveral uh you know wave of the wintersthat came out of the back doorshootout so it\\'s kind of cool I mean wewe heard I think it was cor olera on thebeach during an interview he says yeah Iknow this is the best cuz every time theshootout runs they get the best wavesyeah I mean it\\'s definitely uh beenproducing waves of thewinter more than any other event um youknow and then the fact that we\\'ve gotthis youknow no competition jerseystyle uh surfing going on itI think it just uh really kind of lendsmore to that expression session um youknow not as much pressure kind of styleand the the Surfers respond to it andwhether you believe it or not I thinkthe ocean responds to it yeah yeah oneof my favorite waves was from last yearwith Moana Jones Wong but unfortunatelyit was like seconds after the horn likeone that\\'s right yeah they had the wahheat of all the all the uh women surffirst and yeah it the heat had justended the wave was coming yeah andyou\\'re right it was like the uh thecraziest non-counting 12-pointride oh yeah I was hoping I was likewell yeah the back door shootoutsometimes we Bend rules a little bityeah exactly especially you know for uhfor the W that are out there give themlike tons of credit it is not an easywave an easy atmosphereto be in um it\\'s so competitive on aday-to-daybasis uh you know guys are um just youknow kind of grinding out their surfcareers you know they need a shot todayyou know to kind of to put some food onthe table tomorrow and so you get a lotof heavy competition and plus the dangerof the wave kind of adds to everybody\\'sanxiety and and uh level of energy outthere so uh definitelya lot of the guys a lot of the boys areyou know exuding thatreally excited energy and you know thewah the women got to kind of mix it upand you know get in there and reallycommit you know what\\'s cool what\\'s coolabout this event too is often times it\\'sthe you know it\\'s not segregated bygender so like we had kisore surfingearlier in you know the um New Earthteam or New Earth Earth Project yep umand we\\'ve seen Moana Jones Wong surfwith other teams as well so kind of coolthat you know we have a mixed genderteams

the shifting Sands hererighty socelebrating um you know so manymilestones in in surfing history Dukeclam moku is a great person to hone inon as a as you know an ambassador forthe sport and for Hawaii and you know hedid some amazing things surfing um youknow speaking of you know some somebarriers we talked a little bit abouthaving Carissa Moore in the heat when hewent to Australia um you know he hesurfed with a a local female Australianuh that was there and and that was athat was a unique moment because thereweren\\'t you know women weren\\'t surfingin fact most people you know thereweren\\'t many people suring at all inAustralia at that time um and you knowjust to have Duke um break some of thosebarriers that may have existed he wasincredible at doing that and I think itbecause of his aloh look at thisone Ops out of that one yeah lookingover the ledge couldn\\'t quite get intoit and probably a good ideato just kind of back off of that one andnot force it you know you don\\'t want tobe forcing back door wave pip and that\\'sa beautiful Drop I thinkstalling oh a lot of spit coming outthere didn\\'t get really like too deepbut nice positioning I think that wasGabriel Von uh 14 Peru the groovinperuvians tubosPeru a replay did a good job you knowthe fins kind of came disconnected rightthere and was able to hold on hold theline didn\\'t get superdeep pretty cool to feel that pressurewasher style spit come out of the barreland sting your skin a little bit Hspeaking of pressure washer uh K Katomatsuoka\\'s wave years back a 12-pointride y that thing fire hosed all overhim yeah how he was able to keepstanding uhwas one of the most amazing rides we\\'veseen yeah but back to Duke aoku he didhave this uncanny ability to break someof these boundaries and and it\\'sinteresting because he was a verysoftspoken person like okay in some wayslike people you know said that he was Idon\\'t know shy is the word or justdidn\\'t talk much interestingly peoplesay the similar thing about Eddie IOthat he wasn\\'t very vocal didn\\'t reallyyou know uh follow the spotlight per sewasn\\'t the type of guy like for exampleEddie\\'s uh brother Clyde you give him amicrophone he\\'s pretty comfortablewhereas guys like Duke and Eddie werewere more very humble hins um quietsofts spoken um but Duke somehow despitethat kind of kind of soft um kind ofhumble nature of his that he was stillable I mean able to break a lot ofboundaries in sports in in sportshistory um you know he was during a timethat even preceded some of the thebreaking of color lines with JackieRobinson and others who who were whowere kind of pressing the boundaries ofof some of these color lines in sportsand and Duke was like able to to Reallynavigate that successfully in a way thatwas you know non threatening but at thesame time you know he did make somechange changes and um so you knowdefinitely he\\'s an icon not just becauseof his surfing prowess but also becauseof his demeanor his Aloha and his um youknow softspoken warrioress I guess youcould sayyeah I mean he\\'s also his life he livedthrough various um you know governmentsin Hawaii he\\'s born in the Kingdom ofHawaii territory of Hawaii um even theprovisional government look at this oneoh oh man hits the eject button look atthat wave just peel off right to thecamera pipeline Perfection was on offerright there butunfortunately you know as we see so manytimes that Beyond vertical drop willjust be such adoozy and look at it here gets hung upand does not have achance but man the way that wave justpeeled towards the camera just waslooking like an opportunity that had abig score potentially written all overit but not able to convert and um youknow we\\'ve even said in the past Heatsyou know pipeline has the ability tomake some of the most talented skilledSurfers look like total[Laughter]Barney oh that\\'s the the you know that\\'sthe wave and that\\'s the challenge of ofpipe and that\\'s what you have to beready for you know it\\'s it\\'s it\\'s veryhumbling right to say theleast all right so we have uh pu makamtoo standing by with makua Kai Roth takeit awaypoor amazing performance out there umhow are the waves how are you feelingthe waves are beautiful um I\\'m feelinggreat it\\'s almost been a year to thedate 10 days short of a year since I\\'veuh sured out here proper Pipeline and uhI just feels so good to be back where Ibelong awesome it\\'s awesome to see youback as well obviously this is a veryhistoric event that your dad has helpedput on over the years and um what doesit mean to be in this event and just bearound oh can we watch this wave realquick oh mygosh so I mean this event is just uhit\\'s it\\'s not just my dad you know mydad is you know the founder of uh youknow this event but it\\'s our club\\'sevent the hu and it\\'s each and every oneof us that are part of our club you yourOhana um our Ohana and everybody that uhcomes together to make this happen ourancestors and everybody that came beforeus and I really believe that\\'s why youknow the waves are always there for usbecause this is who we are this is wherewe came from and um just our way ofperpetuating our Aloha and our cultureto the world awesome and last thingobviously this event is in honor of Dukeum what impact has Duke have on yourlife well Duke koku hashad uh a profound effect on life periodyou know all life especially here inHava and everybody that\\'s came you knowbefore and after him and I I think thatuh he would be very happy to see us kakout there and and our club the whhe andAl perpetuating are are surfing ourancestral rights um to the world and Ithink he\\'d be very happy so thank youvery much Duke and you know everyHawaiian water man that came before usMahalo for showing us the way awesomemahaloall right thank you PA andum yeah you know the uh perpetuation ofculture uh the legacy of Duke Kahanamokuand you know hisimpact uh not only with the sport ofSurfing but as a Hawaiian person uh as ayou know Hawaiian individual as we sawzoko Alonzo Korea get a nice pipe waveand try to to squeeze one more out of itbut was unable to make that second one Ibelieve that\\'s Gabriel Von over there atback door just AIT of a frothy kind of Ubumpy wave but was able tofind quick little amount of tube timebut you know and what Duke just did as aperson you know as you said super humbleum you know spoke a lot with hisactions and uh we\\'re you know glad tohonor him uh with this event and lookforwardto yeah I think many more what was coolabout Duke too that he had like reallike influential friends and and maybepart of it is because he put the UnitedStates on the map when it came toswimming in the Olympics prior to thatAustralia dominated and other countriesbut the United States didn\\'t really havea strong presence in swimming in theOlympics prior to Duke and and and so weyou know we see that in the Olympics1912 is the first Olympics interestinglyenough um on land in uh in the othersports in the Olympics Jim Thorp who wasNative American was dominating there soyou had two indigenous peoples in theOlympics for the United States kind ofyou know making a mark for the UnitedStates so that kind of has a you know aprofound impact on sporting history umbut alsojust you know Duke had um influentialpeople that wanted to hang out with himI think cuz he kind of had this Coolvibe right like even though he\\'s he wasa quiet guy like just the fact that hesurfed and if you\\'ve never really seensurfing before and you have this talldark handsome muscular Hawaiian guycomes to your town and has like anexhibit that\\'s what he\\'d have theseexhibitions where there\\'d be hundredsand sometimes thousands of people on thebeach and and they would advertise thesethings and he would show up and and gosurfing and people were just likebasically it\\'s like see The GreatHoudini but up surfing you know and yougo out and perform and uh obviously he\\'sthe only one surfing so All Eyes AreFixed On every maneuver you know everymovement and lot of the ladies loved himtoo and his and the whole Beach Boy Vibewhen um you know this when tourism waswas was pretty small time but you hadyou did have these the lurene which is acruise liner that would come to toHonolulu and bring a limited number oftourists but they would come and theyreally were attracted to you know thisVibe of weiki beach um Jack London oneof the most famous writers at the timewrote about surfing and wrote aboutthese you know Hawaiian Surfers so therewas there was like a kind of romanticyou know Vibe about them and a kind offreeness to it and ever since I meansurfing has really worked to emulatethat spirit that Duke really you knowwas just sort of his behavior and youcan see it in in in Hollywood movieslike the gig for example the story of ofthis young girl learns to surf in inMalibu but on the beach they you knowthey\\'re borrowing a lot of Hawaiiansymbols right of the the plain ukuleleand the Aloha shirt and the grass Shackit\\'s all just trying to emulate whatDuke already embodied and so so much ofthe surf culture is influenced by thisHawaiian man who um really was such acoolcat you know and uh earlier I mentionedsurfing being you know one of the mostuh you know just by Nature uhnarcissistic sports but it\\'salso in the same breath one of thecoolest sports right like I mean youthink of the definition of what cool isand you just have an image of a surferof a guy on a board you know riding orwalking down the the beach carrying aboard yeah and it\\'s justlike you know it does have this Aura oflike this cool factor that is like offthe charts compared to any other sportright yeah so Duke um so one of one ofhis most influential friends was one ofthe wealthiest women in in the worldDoris Duke okay who is the heir of thisum you know this family uh fortune andshe built this shangra law this hugemansion at blackpoint um she\\'d hang outwith Duke and his brothers and wentsurfing with them and so I mean and theneventually there\\'s all these otherpeople who just want to hang out withhim um celebrities movie stars Dukehimself ends up in Hollywood where he\\'she\\'s in several films he\\'s not the starof those films but he\\'s coded in themyou know um and uh and eventually getyou know John F Kennedy and you knowinfluential politicians and um Babe Ruthand so many others who come to Hawaiiand just to see Duke and just to kind ofhave him take them surfing or whateverand and cruise with them and so thatthat\\'s why I mean he he\\'s such a famousperson because you know everyone wantedto S of hang out with him and hopefullyhis coolness would rub off on those thathe was hanging with yeah and you know hedoes have uh this that personalitywhere you could imagine just everybodywho was near him kind of you know feltsome Vibe or like a almost like a like apalpable energy you know a Mana that isreally infectious youknow there\\'s our lineup for team vulccoming up next at Moana Jones Wong thequeen of pipeline will be right in themix there Mike KY berdine noad Deen MPang balaram stack nice looking lineupthere for team vul you know in thebuilding seat ballaram just kind ofwaiting for his heat you know I thinkhis mom\\'s down there with him and he\\'sjust kind of like okay what heat is thiswhen when\\'s When\\'s it my turn so kind ofcool to see the competitors itching toget out there to have their turn hopeingthe condition are good during their heatyeah Bon became the first New Yorker towin the pipe Masters last year sohe\\'s made a name for himself here andhas uh you know worked his way up theranks for sure I mean coming you knowfrom outside of Hawaii a lot of times uhit\\'s a a tough nut to crack if you willto get in here but you know you got asponsor like vulc owning two housesright here Beach fronted pipeline youyou know that helps it helps it givesyou a little tool to start to break openthat shell and you start you know likedoing the laundry sweeping the porchwashing the dishes you know all of theGrom grunt work and uh then you hope toget a a couple of nods to go on somewaves out at pipe you know you got Kimon Henry and Ty van djk and Dave waselall the guys that have been longtimevcam team writers and kind of uh uhquote un uh quote property managersaround here you know not only managingthe houses themselves but you know theteam of who\\'s coming you know wherethey\\'re from how how they rank on theyou know the scale of what level are yougoing to be at the house you know yougoing to be staying on the couchdownstairs or are you going to be in themaster bedroom on the third level youknow there\\'s so many different uh thehierarchy is uh very very apparent andbalaram has been one of those guys thatuh also you know speaking of humilityand and letting his actions speak hasbeen one of those guys that really hasuh come a long way in a short time butthrough nothing was uh just handed overit was a really diligent committed hardwork there you see the screen that\\'sIsaiah\\'s Shak Shaka right up there onthe second floor of the vocal M you seesee where we rank we\\'re we\\'re not toplevelyet we\\'re still midlevel but we\\'re uhsuper oh in front though super gratefulyeah to be on the beach giving you guysuh all the info and the play byplay asthe hoie backo shootout kicks offanother year2024 and it\\'s one of our regular footcompetitors in this team Peru p uh tubosPeru to beexact you know you can I was talkingearlier about um Doris Dukes ShangGrilla um I think she donated that to amuseum the honolu academy the honoluMuseum of Art used to be called TheAcademy of Art uh you can take tours ofit it\\'s kind of a Trippy place becauseit\\'s got all like these Middle Easternkind of U Decor yeah anduh pretty coolstuff well there\\'s a broken board rightthere Hawaiian water Patrolgetting one of our Peruvian team rersback to thebeach and uh hopefully he\\'ll be able tograb another board and head back outstill got seven minutes and 40 secondsremaining it\\'s going to be cutting itkind of close being able to yeah getyour leash on get get to the properpaddle out spot and make it all the wayback out there for another wave but youknow if there\\'s any event that you canprobably pull that off in this amount oftime it\\'s this kind of event whereyou\\'re surfing with your friends thataren\\'t trying to uh get scores to takeyou out right much morecamaraderie um you know Duke koku madehis own surfboards I think a lot ofsurfers back in those days made theirown boards even throughout the 60s and70sum yet had a lot of folks who would maketheir own boards Mark Richards JerryLopez so a lot of them have like a brandbut I think it was just more common forSurfers to make their own boards uh butDuke was definitely known for everywherehe\\' go he wouldn\\'t bring a board withhim he would go to the local lumber shopget a plank and then shape a board andthen surf on that shaped board that hemade often times he would leave theboard there as a kind of gift and as youcan imagine those boards have becomeworth a lot of of money oh yeah um youknow in Australia this was a story andthey still you know have his board upthere as a kind of a a historic markerto the origins of surfing in Australiaso kind of cool that Duke um made surfboards if you get a chance if you\\'re inHawai you\\'re visiting I highly recommendgoing to the Bishop Museum our BishopMuseum has some really cool collectionsof of Hawaiian artifacts but theirsurfboard collection as well uh theyhave a board from du koku that\\'s inthere also princess kolani couple boardsfromher so really cool to go check that outalono okay that\\'s Alonzokareahzoko as uh I\\'veapplied a little nickname for him as youcoin yeah you know I don\\'t ask theseguys like what should I call you what\\'syou know some of these guys come youknow already with a nickname attached orum you know something

youknow one of uh the spots that is quiteuser friendly um it\\'s pretty popularwith the community and all the kids umand even um you know can\\'t you can\\'tbeat Wy I mean is it asking Northshoreor uh on the NorthShore uh wait let meseeum oh it\\'s onahu I Mis read that yeah Imean Wy ke especially I mean we saw themon Brothers out hereand um you know the monise family hasbeen teaching surfing out at weiki formany years we\\'re talking about todayduam moku and he sort of started thistradition of Beach Boy culture and todaywe still have those beach boys that areout there um giving surf lessons and umkind of cool that you know we\\'reperpetuating that tradition of of surflessons and um the Wii Beach Boys thoughthey you know when they first startedteaching lessons in W Kei was a prettylucrative gig in other words like uh itwas a good job they made decent money umthey were in the spotlight quite a bitright and they did more than just dosurf lessons they I mean um you knowthey would play music and um serenatepeople yeah like some take them aroundtown take them to the barue luowstuff what interesting one tandemsurfing got a little intimate but um butyeah Wy ke Beach Boys and to this day Imean you still have that tradition Wykey have learn to surf um so forsure but um unless you want to spectatethen you got to go see Rocky with hisdog surfing this Rocky surf show it\\'s afun thing we are we\\'re blessed to do upat Turtle Bay Resort and um uh trainingour our dogs to ride waves and you knowuh Hawaiians have had you know know uminteresting relationships with with dogsin the past you know as uh companions uhpotentially sometimes as food and um butalso uh there\\'s some really cool oldbeach boy pictures of dogs riding onboards yep with the Wii Surfers for sureyeah and and that\\'s part of that umweiki Beach Boy culture that Duke wasimmersed in and was a part of it becamelike very showman like right so you youtake somebody anduh take a a visiting tourist who\\'s a wahor girl and have him stand up on yourshoulders to bringing a dog out on theboard with you to standing on your heador it became kind of these ShowmanshipAntics that Drew a lot of attention allright here we go check it out back doorthat looks like that is noadDean oh man the silhouette was travelingI thought he might have a chance ohbut um we\\'ve gotuh James asking about helmets atPipeline and um you know I think it\\'s aa good idea I never did wear one um anduh you know admittedly probably not thesmartest idea not to wear one and alsothe reason is because it like it looksdorky and but that thing can really saveyour life wife and um we got some uhsome love coming out from um juicy Smithsaying Isaiah you\\'re a nice guy to Surfwith at Goat Island uhoh and um Oho lookat this this was the split Peak and onegoing that might have been M Pangright that wasnoine and started to really feel thewave gain speed so he pumped and Ithought he might might have a chance tohe went pretty far get shot out righttherebut um and Mario was James Smith okaygarens barar get barreled is uh histitle of his messagehere andum uh your favorite class to teach atBYU Hawaii coming from Colin in SaltLake City ah good question um so so yesso I\\'ve been a professor Bo Hoy for boy17 years now um and you know i\\' usuallyI teach the world history classes okayuh some United States history some worlduh Pacific Islands history y but um youknow as I got a little more seasoned I Icould develop my own course okay so Icreated a course on the history culturalhistory of surfing okay awesome look atthat bam stack Mr all stack as I like tocallthem but it\\'s cool because this becomesclassroom material where you know you wewatch Surf Contest um but it\\'s not allfun in games I was saying earlier likewhen people pick up my book uh waves ofresistance they see Larry burlan on thecover looks like a surf mag or somethingbut um you actually you know my goal isto get people interested and then forthem to um learnhistory so so yeah that\\'s my favoriteclass to teach um these days I\\'mteaching a little a lot less actually uhI\\'m I\\'m I\\'m in administration right nowuh so I\\'m the academic vice presidentand so I\\'m helping to kind of overseeyou know our curriculum and faculty andand so it\\'s been a little different butI\\'ve enjoyed it um really you know somenew challenges new kulana and and soit\\'s um it\\'s been really enjoyable I sawyou I brought a couple of of books frommy reading list today wanted to share umone of them is called surf andrescue and uh I don\\'t know if you\\'recurious of of a reading list from what\\'sgoing on I didn\\'t bring a copy of mybook I I usually do butum but uh yeah so this this one Surf andrescue is is written by Patrick Moserand uh good friend of mine believe it ornot we do have these these conferenceswhere we study um surfing history and uhPatrick Moser is a good friend and doesgreat work and this one is about as Imentioned earlier George free okay andSurf and rescue the birth of Californiabeach culture and he really looks atGeorge free who is a haa Hawaiian soanother words he was a mix of Hawaiianand Caucasian yeah uh went to Californiabecame like this um you know kind oflike the the father of of rescue oceanrescue and um it\\'s a really cool book ittalks about George free kind of sadly umyou know he dies younger in life um umgets sick there\\'s at that time they hadthe Spanish influenza going around Duannamoku actually had the Spanish Flu Wand was very ill but fortunately hesurvived and unfortunately for his goodfriend George free did not wow um soit\\'s a it\\'s a really great story thoughother one I\\'ve been reading lately thisone\\'s a little not surfing um but it\\'scalled sunny skies Shady character lovethat title that\\'s so clever man copskillers and corruption in the AlohaState kind of goes through kind of thisundergroundyeah action but um anyway so that\\'s myreading list uh for you guys today uh wedo have some beach uh action down therewe\\'re going to talk to the Surfers fromour last Heat throwing it down to thebeach I think poor Makaya is still downthere yep standing by with crystal balltake it away guys awesome how are theconditions out there today and how areyoufeeling all right so uh crystal ball wasuh racking up some scores in that lastHeat and we are going to be um wrappingup today day number one with the endingof this final heat the vcam heat butthey\\'ll be out first if we\\'re ontomorrow we\\'ll make that call in themorning it looks uh as though all signsare pointing to being on but it will beuh reverse order of the Heats so vcam wewill be out first followed by team PeruNorthshore boys and so on right up thelist um we\\'ve got uh nicecomments from Mariel thank you so muchand thank you for tuning in we gotPatrick with uh somequestions possibly the firstHawaiians coming from the Marquees andlater on then toTahiti anduh some of you know the different uhhe\\'s asking Scholars that will be youknow saying any truth the rout you knowright yeah so the question here isasking um if H first came from our casesand then later uh some tahan Chiefs cameimplemented the new coupo system umthere\\'s some evidence of that um wedon\\'t I mean we don\\'t know exactly wherethey came from but a lot of people dopoint to um you know maresis as as aspot where Hawaiians originated from butlike I said earlier there\\'s multiplemigrations and in fact the story he\\'sreferring to about tesan Chiefs wasthere\\'s a Chief named PA that is knownto come to Hawaii and look at this onewoo looks like Mak Pang stalling in thebarrel deep with the spit comesout welldone that was a beautiful one might beenM Pangyeah M has really uh developed into anoutstanding pipeline Surfer he\\'s bornand raised here on the NorthShore hisdad Dennis been making boards right uhfor decades out here and a good Surferand Waterman aswell um and check it out just drawing aperfect line getting nice and deep andcoming out and then everybody loves theAirborne Dismount that alwaysgenerates reaction from the crowd on theBeach right right neverfails like woo yeah I mean it\\'s like asas reliable as a Japanese taking apicture throwing a p sign Kawaii yeahthey uh are so still on the PE sign it\\'sgreat and uh just like that as reliableas that the crowd will always uh go wildfor an aerial dis aerialDismount angle beautiful water angle wegot the silhouette in the barrel deep itspits he disappears comes out that\\'swhat we like to see a pipeline the FlyAway out of thescreen uh and uh who\\'s the most badassHawaiian Warrior of all time oh wow wasit uh do we give it to kamehame thefirst uh or there\\'s some other oh manlesser known but very Fierce Warriorslet me first I get back to actually PAwas a pretty fierce dude and he comes umfrom the Pacific we don\\'t know I mean ifit\\'s Tahiti um some would say s cuz hebrought a a chief with him named peelyand peely came up with PA the greatstory of when PA leaves his brother LopPelle is um they\\'re at odds with eachother cuz PA\\'s kind of like kind ofrugged and he\\'s not you know the nicestbrother so PA actually kills his nephewLop Pelle and and puts him into the holeof his canoe as a sacrifice and anoffering before his departure wow uh andLop Pelle is not happy about that uhanyway he sent on his way and thenthere\\'s some people that want to to gowith him and there\\'s a cool story ofthese these um these Maka or likeprophets that wanted to join him and oneof them guy named makua Mana he jumpsoff the cliff apparently floats like abird and lands on this tiny little uh Imean it\\'s it\\'s literally like 3 in thistiny little triangle that\\'s on the backof the canoe and he perches up there forthe rest of the ride comes to Haw is andit is known for being in Haula and acouple other places builds um a heothere called monoa heo anyway I\\'mtalking a lot and hopefully I\\'m not umlosing track of where I\\'m going withthis but yes um there were a lot ofstories and legends of and and historiesof of chiefs that came to Hawaii indifferent waves of migration okay and Pais known for bringing the cup umparticularly worship of the war god coupum and coup is um you know is an actuallike often times C is Manifest into anactual K or an image um kukailimoku isone of these manifestations andKamehameha uh inherits this statueuh you know that is a sculpture I guessyou\\'d call it um and that becomes sortof their source of Mana for um fortaking charge and so a lot of theseWarriors um would bring that coup withthem into battle so I mean PA is one ofthem um Alo also an Avid surfer uh butif you want to read some cool stories ofH history I felt like this would makereally good movies like Kung Fu moviesum alilo and his um his his amazingWarrior um stories that he\\'s you knowand and as a surfer too II is a greatstory um Kamehameha so a lot of thesewarriors were Avid Surfers Kam as Imentioned earlier learned to swim at avery young age was a you know Avidsurfer said his favorite thing to do issurf by jumping off a canoe into bigwaves um and his wife kumanu had a fewwives but kumanu was his favorite wifewho was also a very skilled Surfer um soit\\'s interesting how surfing and andWarrior kind of culture are integratedin Hawaii in times of old and in timesof present yeah so you know having to uhkind of Channel Your Inner WarriorSpirit to prepare yourself mentally forpipeline is been a a common theme and umthing that we\\'ve heard from Surfers atPipeline and and everybody who\\'s kind ofbeen around this this surf break for anyamount of time uh some of the bottoms ofsurfboards um for riding pipeline uh youknow I I probably say the most commonwould be that you know single to doubleconcave right um definitely want somenice sharp edges as uh Papa AA on DaddyDuty right there withuh his little one as we see up inwriting I believe that is Moanaoh oh that might be m k b I think yeah MKai I\\'m going to go back to this Warriorone because I\\'ve got a bunch offavorites okayum there\\'s a couple of kuhao wasactually Kam\\'s trainer like he was likethe mentor Warrior to keha and they saykikua Pio was just an incredible umWarrior and hand to hand combat uh yousee a surfer going to combat herePipeline and I think this is myaiberdine yeah that\\'s uh the wave we justwatched live and the young Northshorekid coming uh up through the ranks andgets a spot on the vcom backdoor whoiebackdoor shootout team for team vul Imean another oneum would be khik Kei who is the ruler ofMaui and as long as that guy was aliveno one could conquer that Island wow uhvery tough dude and um um so Hawaii hasyou know a martial art known as the Luaand it was kind of like a grapplingmartial art uh that you know actuallygets integrated I\\'ve read some oldstories of how when you know Jiu-Jitsuwas kind of an early thing and then someyou know some people talk about how theLua got kind of in some of the earlydays would get mixed in with some ofthat kind of grappling um it was a kindof like bone popping or dislocating ofBones and you know tie people in knotsthey would say um so kind ofinteresting so so anyway yeah there\\'squite a few uh to that answer thatquestion there\\'s quite a few uh Warriorsin in h history look at these wavesstacking up for team vul just a littleover the halfway point 13 minutes 50seconds remaining let\\'s go ball aroundand Mr ball stack can he squeeze out ofof that one not going to be able tosomebody on the back door NoahDean so Noah I believe is the loneregular foot in this heat for team vulcand he\\'sbeen seeking out those back door gemshe\\'s like all right you guys don\\'t wantto go right all Camp over here yep I\\'llI\\'ll take care of Duty on this side youguys watch thatside you guys watch the front door Iwatch the back door stand guard there\\'sthat precarious paddle back out throughback dooryeah uh you have to have nerves of Steelto do thatlike I I would do the paddle around uhbut you kick out and you see those linesto have the kind of DP the P like Ithink I can make it yeah I was like ohI\\'m going the otherway uh we got a message from Eric kaveas we watch a replay of no de\\'s backdoor wave wellpositioned and you saw that last pumpright there to get through that wasreally nicely done um so Eric kav\\'smother\\'s Genoa kave oh a veryaccomplished Hawaiian yeah I know how\\'sit and uh there was a beachboy called IndianPete and um so it was uh his uncle Peterand he was so dark he looked kind ofEastIndian and uh oh wow there was anotherpersonuh wow that was named Patrick PatrickThomas adul I know a lot of Doos inHaula and a lot of them Surfers too soAA to that family Anda to the kav I knowa lot of them musical family um throughgenerations and we still have a lot ofthe K playing hawaian music yeah and soand also you know brought an uncle overhere surfs in a Malo in uh out in townevery time if you don\\'t know what a Malois it\\'s a loin cloth and uh traditionalgarb get rid of the tan lines uh that isum not not a a huge piece ofmaterial um and um the t-shirts guys Ibelieve they\\'re available at theoi.comwe\\'ve got a couple of questions fromMark and uh other folks askingaboutt-shirts for this year\\'s event and Ibelieve they are um at uh theoi.comyeah some viewers tuning in from LasVegas the ninthIslandMahalo okay there\\'s a question about ahistory history of thehoieand um now there\\'s the word hoie in hoenmeans club so there\\'s been many hysthroughout Hawai history political uhhoies um even Duke\\'s club that becameknown as The Beach Boys their Hawaiianname was the Hui nalu club which isbasically Surf Club yeah so huie is agroup that comes together so um you knowoften times you hear today when peoplesay oh the hoie they\\'ll thinkspecifically of the hu nalu but the hunalu is its full name which means theclub of surfers sometimes translated aswave sliders but healo is the word forSurfer surfing so it\\'s a club of surfersum so the huo healo is is born in 19751976 and um here on the NorthShore theHui nalu club uh comes out in like1908 uh some say earlier 1905 they callthemselves The Moana gangand that was in Wy key we saw this backdoor wave that\\'s noine our only regularfooter bus in airsyeah um well I\\'m getting a messages uhit\\'s difficult to navigate theoi.com sowe\\'ll double check on that um with uhour team that\\'s working out the merchandto make it more desirable if it\\'s hardto get it is uh very limited St additionavailability but we\\'ll make sure uh wetry to get the message out to where theeasiest and best place is to purchasesome that replay the back door shootoutt-shirts nice work there from noad deineyeah Noah has gotten two in andoutbarrels at back door in this heat sohe\\'s happy withthat um and uh yeah thatquestion you just answered Isaiah camefrom Craig all the way over in SebBastion Inlet inFlorida and Joff from Ventura County vurCalifornia wondering uh g off uh he hehe he writes it there it\\'s pronouncedJoff oh okay yeah J FF but it\\'s yeahspelled like a with a G um and um youknow who makes the calls uh about youknow those big events Jaws the Eddie Etcand uh each event kind of has their ownum crew yeah that will uh decide whetherit\\'s on or off you know um this theoiback door shootout does as we say itit\\'s event that is more for the Surfersso Surfers do have a lot of say um in togo or no go what the what theday schedule will be or whether it\\'s onor off um yeah we\\'re real fortunatethese days especially we see throughsurf line for example that you can havea forecast that looks pretty far out andyou can try to plan the best you can butsometimes these swells are actuallybigger than expected we saw that with umthat first SW at waya Bay this yearearly on in the year um it it youcouldn\\'t tell until it hit the buoys ofexactly how big it was um but that was areally big one they said it was almostas big as the Eddie that ran last yearand that was massive oh man it was quitemassive it was so consistent uh got acouple questions about the reef you knowwe\\'ve been talking about how shallow itis it\\'s you know only a few feet deepliterally 3 to 4T deep where these hugewaves are breaking and um you know theimpact and the power of these waves Imean if you come down here and sit onthe beach you can feel some of therumble and the vibration and it would beinteresting if anybody had access to aRoR scale right uh to measure what kindof impact and what kind of um you knowreadings we would get from these wavesand how much energy is being releasedand displaced but great questions um thepunch of these waves definitely uhenough to uh harm even the most talentedSurfersum and uh Patrick wanted to uh hear moreabout or the any truth to the Duke\\'sLongestRide uh riding uh from way outside youknow maybe I think that\\'s Castle way outthere so when the South swells getreally big outside of Wy key there aresome uh pretty spectacular waves thatcan be ridden and you can go for a longtime yeah so that yeah there is thatstory and I think um you know there wassomeone who umconfirmed confirmed that I think it wasuh Tom Blake that confirmed that he sawDuke\\'s wave um that he caught from wayoutside Castle so it\\'s like an outerReef outside of where the Outrigger umis today Outrigger Canoe Club not thehotel yeah way out to the left and rodeit all the way across into the beach atlike Queens area or at least maybe tolike where walls is today and so we haveyou know some um confirmation that thatdid happen and that would be you knowprobably what a th000 yards maybe youknow oh yeah 10 football fieldcuz you\\'d have to go through all thosespots at old man\\'s and that and then getthrough the Publix and then ride it fromPublix all the way across to walls um soone thing I will say though is you knowI\\'m sure you know it\\'s possible Wy Kiwas different as far as the surf isconcerned back then because once theydredged the alaw canal um you know theriver changed and you know as we knowthe relationship between the land andthe waves um Through Rivers is kind ofessential to the development even hereat pipeline right this Valley back hereas water would come through kind of cutthrough the reef yeah um and most surfspots that have a channel that channelis formed from a nearby River um and soonce that was diverted it was good foralamana BS it kind of created a new wavein some ways for alamana BS but Wy keychanged quite a bit here we go Rider upthis looks like Ballam stu oh yes it wasand he wasflying through that barrel and then gotdismounted flutteringboardless and his his legs were kind ofkicking in the air it\\'s like waitwhere\\'s my board it was right here undermy feet now it\\'s gone it\\'s hard cuzthese are all goofy Footers and the thesun is headed down and we get kind ofback lit here could have been mik KYberdine I think it was ball okay yep Igot a glimpse of the board he was ridingyep oh yeah that is uh Mr ball stack andthen that backwash is what reallycreatedthe the mess right there for balaram andthankfully he\\'s up and okay so close tocoming out ofthat um Tobias Duffy chimes in withuh saying he came across a giant Hao onthe valley floor of yeha and uh it\\'sgated a road leading to it is protectedby cam lands I never find informationabout it um yeah there\\'s a few heo umnear waya UA the bay and the today it\\'salso the there\\'s a valley that wayaValley is a park um and kamea schoolsowns a lot of the property around thatum so there\\'s a few heo one is on um theyou know the Northeast side of the ofthe bay up that everyone knows rightright yep that\\'s the one that isuh very intact and well known butthere\\'s also as pointed out here anotherheo on the west end of that and theyveum I mean my wife is actually ananthropologist and she you know we andyou know there\\'s some people that havedone a lot of work over there with thatheo on making sure that you know it\\'staken care of so heo if you don\\'t knowheo is like a uma a significant kind of a shrine there\\'svarious there\\'s different sizes of themum Temple is probably not the right wordbut a structure oh my goodness uh wehave some third reers outside at the topof your screen right there those are notclouds here it comes boys big whitewater Ezra

I\\'m surethere\\'s a lot of peanut gallery in themorning it\\'s flat call it off it\\'s notgoing to be good and then you\\'re waitingaround and then you start to see some ofthe things unloading uh does now thebutterflies starting to come in or areyou ready for it I think you know what Inoticed is cuz I\\'m staying down at logsin the beach and actually when it\\'ssmaller it\\'s louder it\\'s almost likekind of gets you more buzzed out whenyou\\'re trying to sleep you just like upat 4:00 a.m. and then it\\'s like two footbut then when it\\'s bigger it\\'s deceivingand you can\\'t hear it as much you knowbut then it\\'s like oh my goodness but Ifeel like Hawaii is the kind of placethat you kind of give it its respectbecause it can be macking in a matter of2 or 3 hours like it\\'s just

I mighthave to hit up hzy Bayfor for one of his weird ones yeah sobut you you you\\'re getting some uh localknowledge right here on the North Shoreyou\\'ve been working with uh someone whokind of knows how to serve pretty goodout of back door could you talk us aboutwhat what\\'s going on with you and theThe Godfather yeah so actually I wasback at home in Australia I\\'ve beenworking with G Brad GAC doing his wavekey and just I\\'ve I\\'ve also just comeoff a pretty bad back injury for thelast like two years I\\'ve been grindingout with him and then coming over here Ii\\' always try and look for someone who\\'sa local and just any sort of tips I canjust you know absorb in and um um girlwas like you should hit up uman Shaneyou know let\\'s let\\'s get you out of herelike are you kidding dude Shane\\'s likelike you said the god Shane Dorian forthose who are listening in so um no I\\'msuper super honored to be working withhim as well and you know I mean it waskind of weird waves the last few daysbut I mean the first day was amazing butI\\'m still taking in any information Ican and any minute out pipe so like withthree other guys you you\\'re winning sohow\\'s it been working uh with with withwith Brad I mean he he was texting me acouple days ago and he just couldn\\'tstop talking about how much he enjoysworking with you uh your surf style asas well as just your energy because youknow Brad\\'s an energy guy but you got tosort of be willing to like let go ofwhat you know as he\\'s sort of taking youinto the roots doing this technique workof wave key yeah totally well I the wavekey thing is kind of like the it\\'s likethe Mr Miyagi Karate Kid you know youjust it\\'s how to like get better atsurfing on land you know and just you\\'veseen Brad style it\\'s amazing and that\\'ssomething I think he really tries toimplement into everyone surfing or justhelp them out with is a beautiful formto you surfing yeah we\\'ll call you Kaason oh I think mol\\'s looking at a wavecomingin yeah the stakes are High I mean thisis it this is this is the final deal kirPinkerton needs a 14 if she wants to getinto m contention for the F oh Mollypicklum what good job no way no waypresent how was that pump into thatthing how was that look up that headlook up to be like okay here\\'s where I\\'mat and then that rail pull mly Pim shesaid she\\'s been studying like she saidshe was really frustrated with herbackhand Barrel techniqu so she juststarted watching Benji brand like videosand clips she\\'s like I studied it and Ilearned a technique from watching himand I\\'ve been applying it which kind ofsurprises me because you usually seeBenji going left right frontside but I know look at this thing fulldouble up too oh yeah that pump hey thatwas like an MF chopes pump one of thoseand then the claimyeah wow look at this right here doesn\\'tyank the rail just enough to pull in toride that pick that line lookingwow no okay time to go go out the doorlet\\'s go 20 years old yeah I mean thisisthis sheneeds that claim was was epic herconfidence like she just walks with likethis confidence of like yeah this isme I amme wow that to me that right therewithout I think what makua was saying aswell it may seem very very subtle to theviewer that idea ofum well it just looked like she gotbarreled but a lot of people sometimesforget that in a barrel there\\'s so manylines you can take and you can easily gotoo high or too low and to have thatconfidence to not only change your lineso she goes down she changes her lineand then she holds that line and then rebreaks that line again to straighten outthat\\'s like really Technical and there\\'sso many nuances when it looks easythat\\'s often times the hardest umdemonstrator it\\'s the highest level ofdifficulty you\\'ll probably see that comeout too in the school hey I\\'m sure Imeandefinitely judges going to take theirtime but that\\'s going to be that\\'s goingto be a big score out of some possible30 again three judges not unlike yourtraditional um WSL event championshipevent uh where you havefive judges and a high and a low beingthrown out this is just the three judgesgoing one through 10 take their threescores add them up into one score bestobviously being 30 points we see the sunstarting to come out now Shining Lighton the land in theocean look at those buttery conditionsit\\'s like all oily right now dreamsiclesyou can see the plumes of sand startingto move off of The Reef with theNorthwest swell again29.4 for Molly wow wow perfect so that\\'sthree variations of a nine perhaps thejudge gave a 10 we\\'ll see uh theirindividual scores at some point buthighest score of the comp so farwow and I agree with that that I thinknot like I\\'m a I mean I\\'m not a judgeyou know you know what you\\'re talkingabout I think they saw what we saw youknow they saw what we sawCarissa wow okay Carissa no pulled in alittle too deep on that kind of pinchedthat thing kind of came off of TheReef for the size um I don\\'t think thatwas the right anglewave when we when we talk about thecriteria wave selection wave selectionbeing such sokey how do do you pick out the right waywhat are you look what are you lookingfor in a in a in the right wavetoday I mean with the growing swell I Ithink you want those ones that almostlook like those double UPS you knowthose real like either if it\\'s a rightyou want that little kind of hip downthe end where you can see it\\'s going tothrow that extra curtain you can kind ofmaybe race through or just like Molly\\'sone you know you almost want to see thatfirst section going over and and waitfor that one that\\'s kind of standing upa bit moreum I definitely think they\\'re paying thebigger waves too as the SW as peing youknow probably going to be wanting to gothose ones like Molly just got in yousee sometimes when these on the incomingswell you can see that there\\'s a littleswell in front of this wave coming inthis is very consistent with a a longperiod incoming swell there\\'s a littlebit of a wave in front again it\\'s stilltrying to find that Rhythm thatfrequency from the storm as it movesacross those long distances and acrossthe ocean so they\\'re going to besome swells that are almost stacking ontop of each other just a little bit outof rhythm and that can be a real recipefor disaster when you\\'re taking offyou\\'re taking off into a wave that has alittle wave in front of it and with thelittle bit of sand on the reef um withsand on Shore and this incoming swell uhthe women have the gnarliest conditionsof the day I think um it\\'s going to bethe fast move the longer period alsomeans that the wave\\'s going to be movinga lot faster so it\\'s going to be again alot of late drops um it wouldn\\'t be abad idea to maybe have a little bit morerail to get into ituh Betty Betty yeah having a look atback doorand taking the exit this is a reallystacked heate day I mean I yeah this islike a super heat right here yeah I meanthey\\'re all they\\'re all super Heats yeahwell this onetoo people only need14 11 Kira and Betty Lou 14 and 11respectively that\\'s look you dividethese by three right to get what theyneed midgrade scores scores yeah I meanthat\\'s essentially getting a barrel anybarrel and they\\'re getting throughespecially for Betty Lou and and whatalways seems to be the case and I\\'m sureyou\\'ve experienced this Ka like when youneed a a four as opposed to when youneed an eight and you\\'re coming down tothe back end of a heat it starts to getcan get in your head yeah yeah I feellike that\\'s when you want to kind of tryand get into that Zen Lotus State youknow when you just want to be chillingright out and not letting the bubblstart to Fizz up dud you see Zen butaren\\'t you you\\'re like a like a a zedhead right you\\'re you\\'re heavy metalcalms medown I\\'m like I\\'ll put some like Slayeron in the morning and just get in aLotus pose and just like totally BlissoutNamaste yeah that\\'s that\\'s my zen Slayerfor the Slayer yoga Ka is teachingSlayer yoga uh consists of a lot ofmoshing that neck ready I heard that youuh had an

isthat\\'s fantastic I hope you get it yeahI\\'m fingers crossed all right sick welllet\\'s take a look at how this heat hasgone by here\\'s Betty Lu Sakura Johnsonagain just needing that score of an 11she get pinched on that back door waveuh that\\'s a nice pocket ride I would sayand then the if the turn completed Ithink it would have been a a high scoreMolly\\'s wave though this was thestandard Setter for the day yeah Techthat pump man that pump was amazingcould you imagine Glenn hall right nowon in front of hisscreen look at that thing oh my goodnesshe\\'d be screamingyeah that\\'s mygirl yeah it seems like uh RIS didn\\'treally do too much much so far in theheat but I mean she has such a strongstanding right now well you can see allthe sand that\\'s filled up on thosecracks of the reef but what what\\'sinteresting is now that there\\'s sand inthe cracks of the reef now you can seejust how many caves and holes there areum it\\'s there\\'s a there\\'s a certainregion as you can see that there\\'s aheavy uh cracks groov and Spurs is whatthe coral Community likes to call themuh and it\\'s reallyconcentrated near the pipeline Barrelwhere you can see back door there\\'s nota lot of cracks are filled in with anytypes of sand that\\'s just a flat sectionessentially the closeup Ka just lookedat you like he was like grooving SpursI\\'m taking that with me groovy band nameor songname please tell me you have a band tooI actually do me and my brother we\\'reputting out an album inFebruary what are you guys called rightnow I don\\'t really know maybe spinalRevisited or something maybe Groen Spursmaybe Groen Spurs who knows oh the coralwill thank you but um yeah it\\'s music Ifeel like it\\'s one of those things thatgoes with surfing so well you know Iagree you you should check out um EddieSuzuki Eddie Suzuki EddieSuzuki he\\'s got some good he\\'s got somegood electric guitar he\\'s uh I thinkfrom the late 70s early \\' 80s Hawaiianoh really musici definelycheck out all right 2 minutes and 30seconds to go this is the last chancefor Kira Pinkerton and Betty Luc SakuraJohnson to make this final rememberthere is nopriority no so you can need to getyourself in position as you would uhjust at a regularsession they\\'re holding a pretty tightpack there too yeah and they quitelot of friendships being born right herein this last two minutes bety is is weinto the sameuh back door a she just keeps she\\'sgetting desperate for it and who knowslike what\\'s happening is is Carissasending her on okay drama let\\'s startthe rumor Mo that\\'s where she needs tojust try and get into that you know thatbut you see Carissa pad P you know likethese are all tactics that you Championsknow how to say oh I\\'m going to go onthis oh this must be a good one yeah theKumbaya is over as we\\'re trying to makethis final and Carissa is not going togo unless she needs or has a bigopportunity to go she\\'s going to try andforce hands with less than a minuteBetty Lou needingbasically three fours Molly\\'s pumped shejust is like go flat let I did my thingdoesn\\'t look like there\\'s much on thehorizon yeah with it looks pretty flatout there these new swells huh you havethose big LS I feel like and then itjust you get those 15minute pulses butyeah it\\'s going to be maybe one heateveryone I think might get opportunityin their heat but it\\'s only like a oneopportunity to get qualitywaves see some scratching y here with 1012 seconds togo we will Kira or Betty Lou get anopportunity in these lastseconds oh man they willnot damn that wasclose well the strong strong effort putin uh by both kir Pinkerton and BettyLuca Kura Johnson we congratulatethem on their pipe Mastersperformances but for now Carissa moreand Molly Pam and how\\'s that for unfairoh after the horn Betty Lou of coursegetting a back there bar a smash at theend especially when she just needing ina that\\'s almost worse when that happensyou\\'re just like off 20 seconds Lyeah good good showing Betty Lou yeah Kayou are a champion entertaining as canbe thank you for coming through and uhand joining us y Che wish the absolutebest good luck uh with your with yournew band

lucktoday oh that was a that was anice that was a niceuplifting greatenergy moment great energy I you theperfect amount of likenot normal yeah like like Sophie Bellstyle like just the right amount of likeyeah yeah good weird good weird goodweird you need good weird I mean todayyou\\'re going to have to get weird forsure sure cuz it\\'s be a lot of factorslike Mak was saying can you picture himin a big old Hemi leftand drive DodgeChallenger through PirateBay I was going to say Kentucky you likewhat is that thing driving around hereall right well the big question as wehead here into heat 2 this 28 minutes asyou see flies by uh we know thatCarissa and Molly are sitting on the78.9 and a76.90 respectively will it be enough tokeep them in the final as mahina Mahawanted to make that second section asthat pipeline wave ranoff um having a look here Sierra Kerronly needs 11.7 bana cop 12.4 notmuch what a dramatic change to lastyear\\'s uh energy of the women where lastyear it was abit um there\\'s a bit more thinkinghappening with women it seems this yearthere\\'s less thinking more going moregoing yeah yeah they\\'re definitelysending it a lotmore I mean the progress is is is basedin Opportunity we\\'ve been talking aboutthat for the entire event you know KKennedy pointed out like that folksmight not understandhow being able to just surf pipelinealone not hassling with 150 people whatthat puts into the memory banks whatthat does for your confidenceyeahand you know obviously we can\\'t we wedon\\'t have the woman\\'s mind so we can\\'treally speak on behalf of probablywhat\\'s going on we\\'re just um we\\'realiens to that perspective from the maleperspective looking at it sometimes Ifeel magic happens when the thinkingkind of turns off and the feeling takesover right and the power of of a woman\\'sthis what women bring to men or or toany that energy thatso so much feeling that they exude intheir person that we\\'re seeing peoplelike M Karissa you know Sierra last yearwhen she got that insane back door wavelike a lot of them you see them like Idon\\'t I I don\\'t know I didn\\'t think Ijust it just happened right and there\\'ssome magic that is and then able tocarry that forward oh Brianna going overthefalls taking a little heavy one yeahagain there there\\'s going to be thesewaves that are really going to bejacking up on thereef Aron andSierra they kind of seem to be the nextbig thing yeah the the they are thefuture that is now let\\'s take a look atthis uh event format um for those of youmaybe who\\'ve missed the last couple ofdays or need a little refresher in thewomen we have 20 Surfers five Heatsthree rounds and we aretaking their three best scores judge onejudge two judge three no four or five nohigh or low those top three waves intoonescore andleaderboard fluctuating as eachcompetitor is essentially competingagainst the rest of the field for that$100,000 that\\'s not that\\'s not smallmoney that\\'s 100 Grand is is literallymore than most professional Surfers in2023 will make total it\\'s it\\'s lifedifference money in the sport ofprofessional surfing uh as the surfindustry has gone through some changesin the last few years the the the moneyis just not lying all over the place soit incredible of Vans to put you knowsuch strong prize money behind uh theVans pipe Masters S A looking hey youlook at that prize purse you also ohMah let\\'s go little double handdrag we we\\'ll take a look at that fromthe front from mahina but there\\'s thattrademark mahina may had a smileyou know you look at that uh that prizepurse we can\\'t forget about the the taxman I think it\\'s something like30% yeah whichum there is uh something where you canuh donate tax money to get uh taxcredits to nonprofits 51c3s um you\\'re going to have the IRS atyour door as soon as this heat is overthey sir can we talk to you what are youtalking about AaronBrooks waiting for this thing to throwyeah oh she she did all the right thingsand then the wave was like no waveselection that\\'s all that was that\\'sjust that\\'s the youth it\\'s going to getbetter and better the more she\\'s outthere and killer style killerdropSierra again doing they\\'re they\\'re kindof into the pumps they\\'re into thebackside J in my mind I see Jam Brian asthe the pump backside pump[Music]mastersimilar is that similar technique towhat we saw Molly Pamexecuting again Sierra K is 16 years ofage and an incredible she\\'s lived a lotin those 16 years uh stab HighChampion um incredible air that she didat Lakey Peak that was kind of H aroundthe world at stephigh just won the ISA World Juniorsshe\\'s working on her own uh feature filmthat she\\'s been shooting all over theworld we heard Josh Kerr in an interviewyesterday um he was asked you know whenwhen\\'suh when\\'s Sierra getting on tour when\\'sSierra getting on tour and he\\'s likewe\\'re not in any rush you know that\\'sthe demands and how the how aboutthe the advantage that she has in beingable to have that experience in herhousehold yeah from the years that thatJosh did on tour to be like there\\'sthere\\'s literally no rush because of itrequires a lot he I believe he said hehe said specifically we\\'re going to letSierra become a woman and then make thatdecision when she wants to that\\'s coolto to be able to have that Outlook as aparentum we know you\\'re out there listeningdad and mom who want your child to be ontour at age eight I mean you go to anyNSSA event uh on a on a on a weekend uhthe energy of of you know enthusiasticand passionate parents but sometimes theway they\\'re driving these kids thesedays scos you\\'re just like this they\\'rejust kids call up kais get on hisband can be a scream in the band of thespur grooves yeah it\\'s not that seriousyet let them bekids yeah it\\'suh living vicariously through yeah whichI\\'m doing uh through these women rightnow I\\'m some of these waves and I wouldbe even if I got that last wave themahina got this morning I\\'d be stokedknow perfect of a day it is it\\'s funnywe we we saw the the similar techniquebetween Molly pum and here Ur they\\'vebeen spending time together stand byAaron Brooks oh comeon oh who that would have beensomething looking looking at that anddoingthat yeahwhoa again another16yold originally from bornTexas I mean and she\\'s just beentraveling around the world surfingnothing but heavy waves since she wasprobably six or seven look at this thinghumped I think they\\'re going to they\\'rethey\\'re probably going toreally be a major threat and you knowwhen it comes to like these sort ofbarrels I mean look at Moana likemoana\\'s some of the waves that Moanagets out at pipeline it\\'s not like ohthat\\'s good for a girl or it\\'s good fora woman the waves that Moana is gettingout at pipe are some of the best yeah Imean look at the tutelage that Aon hasbeen under you know she\\'s worked withMiles padaka you know Shane bash andShane Dorian U kaha Hart from a veryyoung age I mean she\\'s taken the littlebits from all of those Legends and she\\'salready uh able to apply it look atthat don\\'t look at the replay on thatone that thing just blewlife into theworldohcareful when you fall in that outsiderail at a place like this that\\'s whenyou just you just want to make sure yousee uh the athlete come back up outsiderail that is one of the themost the worst situations to happen ohAaron back at it wow good job ohyes that was[Music]sick yeah good job that was a good oneImean gets packed in the close outpaddles right back out and just boomthis is what\\'s crazy about this waveliterally less than a minute if thatclose out caught a wave with only fourpeople in the lineup back out got a waveknow this is the dream when people sayoh surfing pipeline only four people outthisisAaron that\\'s a that\\'s proper yeah yeahshe bounced through that that had a nicepump up over that foone ball take usthrough it stall and then let go rightin the oh kind of held on maybe when alittle bit uh Sophie Bell close the eyesnow just BriBraille oh this was Sierra\\'s one thatshe didn\\'t go on look yeahthat I wonder if we\\'re going to get apost he interview of what do youremember that wave guarantee it did shelook back atit oh good don\\'t even oh don\\'t even lookback she didn\\'t see it good what youdon\\'t know won\\'t hurt you yeah oh howbummer how about the just endless flurryof waves that these women in heat 2 havebeen able to get after AaronBrooks waiting for ascore you know there\\'s a a bit of nervesbecause people know big

hand\\'s reallystrong and um I don\\'t know I just took Ijust saw the wave and it kind of cameunderneath and it looked like a littlebit longer so I just wanted to roll thedice and see cuz I haven\\'t really hadmany long waves out there and then Ijust took off and all was stoked cuz Ihad to like do a bit of a pump and kindof ride it for a little bit um and thenI was like came out and claimed it andthen I did like two sharkers cuz I toldmy friends if I get a sick one I\\'ll dothat for them sick that\\'s so good andgot a little present for you another bagof cashwhat how\\'s that feels W I\\'ll

kind of holdingherlinewow with aspit again having that confidence to youknow hold that line and when the wave isis behind you on a back on the back sideyou\\'re you know she\\'s looking forwardshe\\'s not trying to look up around she\\'strying to find her line and that takes abit of a fair bit of confidence to thinkokay this thing is going to Barrel Ijust got totrust and pick that line confidence isnot something that Sierra Kerr lackslet\\'s look at it from theback fulldisappearance blown outwe love it we love to see it I Idon\\'t you know just Within These firsttwoHeats there\\'s not I don\\'t really feelthere\\'slike the the distinguish between men\\'sand women\\'s there\\'s it\\'s just it\\'sdisappearing literally as we\\'re watchinglike you said in real time those wavesthat those

keeps improving theswell is building what an exciting dayoh yeah beautiful it\\'s um you knowearlier this morning I know people wereworried aboutuh they\\'re worried about the Wes beingsmall and who serves first and I thinkthat uh perfect call being made womengetting put into some nice beautifulconditions here at Pipeline and K it isso much easier to call these seats whenthere\\'s something to talk about that\\'sright yeah we were we were struggling onthat other day oh my gosh it was likepulling teeth with long LS trying tofill the space just make up whatever youcan to keep the heat not boring today itwill not be a factor it\\'s going tobeepic and pumping right now a littlelow in the action that last Heat waswave after wave after wave and you knowI heard a girl come in and be like ohman you know it just wasn\\'t enoughthere\\'s no excuses today they\\'re outthere you can put yourself into that topfour if you really want it it\\'s therefor you to getit so with 24 minutes left in this heatMoana Jones Wong is looking to get oneof those scores on your screen you seethey\\'re up into the 20o range thesegirls are getting up to 29 Pointsalready this morning so K the sky ispretty much the limit all of thosescores should be changed in should youwant to get into one of those covetedtop fourspots that\\'sright so glassy this morning justpicture perfect conditions here atpipeline that\\'s been pretty goodconditions this whole entire event withlots of wind on the horizon our contestdirector Nathan Fletcher no stranger toPipeline and to knowing what good wavesare and to making sure all the Surfersget a chance to hit all the curriculumhere we have up and riding Sophie Bellon just a quickone today those quick ones aredefinitely not the call you could getyourself really hurt I seen some girlstaking off and jumping off right at thepeak yeah and it\\'s almost like if you\\'regoing to come in you might as well ridethe wave out and paddle around it\\'s amuch easier to get back out from theinside but talking about get back outthis girl got in she got out she got oneof the biggest scores of the day theever beautiful Sierra Kerr downstairswith Holly Sierra you\\'ve moved up intofourth place that in that last Heat wegot Moana Jones and the rest of thefield to go three more Heats remaininghow you feeling reck it\\'s going to beenough oh I was really trying to get onemore but I couldn\\'t make another so Idon\\'t know I\\'m just hoping but glad youhave gotten one at least sick and uh wesaw your dad up there giving you somepointers positioning wise how much doeshe help you get those waves oh yeah hehelps a lot because you can\\'t reallyright now especially because the sun\\'sum where I normally put my lineup on themountains so you can kind of see hisboard a little bit and you know that umthere\\'s a set coming so that\\'s good anduh you got a 29 out there really sickhigh score uh we got another bag ofcash looking let\\'s check out this othat\\'s all hehas Si all right enjoy the rest of yourday me she deserve thank you so muchHolly this young woman\\'s future is sobright above the lip and behind thecurtain there on your screen you see16-year-old SRA Kerr just absolutelydominating the surf world and that isAaron Brooks\\'s counterpart right therethat will be her competition and he andMaka all the women in this heat righthere need two new waves to make the topfour so they got their work cut out forthem this is the heat that counts yeahdefinitely and you see on screen dad anddaughter right there Josh CER one of thebest Surfers in his own right in his daylike they said he\\'s surfing better thanever and uh to get that coaching is justthat is priceless right there to have afather that kind of a relationship withhis daughter competing right there butlike you said kiala in this heat Surfersneed at least two excellent scores eachto start to get into an advancingposition and right now Moana JonesWong is she\\'s got to be tripping she\\'sshe\\'s sitting in her lineup there\\'s nowaves she just seen the lineupabsolutely light up in fire the lastHeat and now she\\'s sitting there with nowaves 20 minutes to go but isn\\'t thatkind of how it goes like I feel like oneone or two Heats will just be NonstopAction and speaking of action there wasMoana right there tucking into thebarrel oo big grab ra I don\\'t know whatshe needs but I\\'ll tell you what thatwave was not close to the other onesthat the girls caught with those bigscores I really think that maybe alittle strategy to better one of hermaybe her third wave and uh get outthere with 20 minutes left still has alot of time to catch those two excellentscores but that right there could be youknow a strategy she could you knowbetter one of her lowscores move up help her up just a littlebit you know so so the ask is not somuchI mean look at this beautifulpositioning tucking in I mean she rodethat wave as good as you can ride itjust uh I could tell by the size of herboard she\\'s looking for something muchmore substantial but nonetheless abeautiful Barrel righthere by your reigning pipelineQueen Moana JonesWong what can you say about this girl\\'srise KKman um funny story about Moana so Iguess when we were I guess when she waslike 14 or something she surfed in herfirst pipe contest it was like one ofthose one stars that Betty deolo puts onand apparently like I might have likeyelled at her to get out of my way orsomething like that and she held on tothat Grudge for years and years andyears and we actually got into itspeaking of getting into it ohbig wipe out right there was that SophieBell yeah those are some of the thingsyou definitely want to stay away from uhcatching the waves and just jumping overthe falls just because I could see ifthere\\'s scoring potential on that wavebut um you know that that wasa that was an elevator drop I mean thatwascharging and the some sets right here onthe horizon who do we have Moana JonesWong looking at this one and that\\'s whatI\\'m talking look where Sophie Bell isnow that\\'s that is a bad spot inabsolute apex of the wave and uh that\\'swhat happens when you jump over thefalls or kick out in the big of the thiswipeout just freef falling from the top ohthat wave was actually not bad she justgot hung up in the lip there yeah kickthe board out one thing about thesewaves out here at Pipeline and back dooryou want to be underneath it as you cansee here she\\'s kind of on top of theledge you see how how there\\'s kind ofthe Waves doubling up underneath her andshe has to kind of go over that ledgeright there these kind of waves you wantto be down the face pulling in ohingabout pullingin yeah just like I said there shecomes that\\'s the Moana we know we needto see that from beginning to end butI\\'ll tell you what thisgirl this young woman right here is justwhat it\\'s all about to serve pipelineshe is so happy there\\'s Bab lefts andhere\\'s the replay I mean look at thatjust charging by theboil beautiful takeoff textbook dropback door in the section blown out she\\'shappy she is stoked that is going to puther right back in the she needs to getinto this top 10 uh this top four rightnow know being you know all the thingswe said all the things she\\'saccomplished I mean she\\'s really got achip on her shoulder I think watchingthose other girls get those good wavesat at her spot that was beautifulI mean nobody likes to give up the strapand she\\'s uh fighting back for it rightnow one more wave like that and I canalmost guarantee you that Moana JonesWong will be in that top fourspots Ian look at that looking exactlywhere she needs to be perect lineperfect stance getting low touching thewall with her hand knowing where she\\'sat look at thatspit guess what how good how good doesthat feel when you get blown out of abig barrel at pipeline oh feels muchbetter than when you don\\'t get blownout welcome to the booth hello you guysare lot lot of action you guys know himas the wizard behind John JohnFlorence\\'s Madness Mr John fil hi guyswhat\\'s up thanks for joining us thismorning yeah that was sick so fun fact20% of the competitors in this event areriding your boards oh that\\'s epic yeahyeah sick I love it wow it\\'s goodhopefully they\\'re doing doing good aslong if they\\'re going to do good it\\'lltranslate into sales and we\\'ll be offwith thesunset well you know that being saidthere\\'s a reason a lot of these peopleare riding pisel boards out here I meansome of the best pipe Surfers to everlive um especially in this generationright pel I mean if you don\\'t know theman you must be hiding under a rockbecause his boards have won some of thegreatest events ever it\\'s ridden by oneof the best Surfers on planet Earth andum you\\'re just kind of pushing thelimits and and experimenting and makingnew things for these Surfers that surfpipe all the time and can you talk aboutmaybe a little bit about the equipmentEvolution out here that you\\'ve been seeyeah like what does it take to make theperfect magical pipeline board I wish Iknew I\\'m trying I\\'m still trying tofigure it out um I think the uh the coolthing here about living here obviouslyis that I just get to work like justnaturally with all these like kidscoming up like they\\'re all young kids inthe beginning or whatever and then thekids that I\\'ve been working with likeincluding your brother have Co um havejust become they\\'re like the guys atpipeline which is pretty cool for me andum they\\'re just all it it\\'s funny likearound the world you they\\'re they\\'reseen as like these pipe Superstars orwhatever but they\\'re just like the kidsfrom down the street or whatever youknow Co lives 50 feet from my house Johnlives down the road Ian you know Nathantoo and um so it\\'s just been fun workingwith those guys and like actually justgetting to watch what they do and thenusing their feedback to try to improveevery you know what is what is harder tomake the perfect pipe board or to shapea board say for a wave like trestles umI think both of those have a really bigchallenge it\\'s a matter of like justkind of uh looking at what the wave isgoing to do and what kind of poweryou\\'re working with and all that stuffso those are such different boards andif you try to ride one for pipe attrussels obvious look at this up againwow just got to get a better one thanthat yeah that was sick but kind ofsmall yeah um what was her last score Iwouldn\\'t know what her she\\'s in 64 no soshe\\'s in fourth she got a 28 she\\'s infourth already so she\\'s up in the fourthspot with one wave all right so28.9 that\\'s sick um yeah anyways they\\'reboth they\\'re both uh real challengingand for me it\\'s important like uh livinghere in Hawaii it\\'s really importantthat like I travel a lot to shape andlook around and just pay attention towhat\\'s going on with different boards indifferent places and try not to be toolike centered on boards that are justfor Hawaii and that\\'s just the importantpart for me is like learning as I\\'mtraveling and listening to people and myfeedback from my team and step will helpme make boards for crappy waves too notthat trestles is crappy but while we\\'vebeen speaking with John it\\'s okay Moanagot an 18.2 and a 29 28.9 in less than 5minutes moving up into the fourth spotyes I mean look right here this must bethe uh 18.2 I mean not that deep on thatone kind of more of a pocket ride but uhthe way before that beautiful stallingmaneuver and uh now you see Sierra Kerris out of the top four officially shewill not be competing in our finalsMoana Jones has taken that fourth spotand she is looking to move up aswell it must be a big thing uh pisel touh get the right Surfer with the rightboard under their feet because allSurfers tend to Surf a lot differentlydifferent styles on waves for sure sohow do you kind of tailor make do youmake one model that kind of fits all oris there certain tweaks that certainSurfers like to make wa that was a latejob lip in the head rightthere um I think that uh what I kind ofstart with the basics that work good formost people and then Terry like tunethose boards for each guy basically orgirl either way and um just try to makesure that like if there\\'re those guysare giving me feedback so like I haveguys some guys that ride a little widernoses or a little more you know justdifferent rockers or different thingsbut like all of that basically comesfrom like a basic starting point thatboards that I know have worked good atpipeline for a long time and then youjust work off that and tailor it to thethe the surfer you know nice and hereyou go as you talking boards we seeboards coming to the beach right nowSophie Bell looks like uh she got herBell rung a little bit right there onthatone and uh you know just you got to becareful out here it\\'s you know pipelineis not really for everyone and thesegirls are definitely charging but uhsome of those waves you got to becareful where you jump off and how youjump off I mean you seen Chum\\'s brotherum joal chanka jump off on a wave afour-footer in the wrong spot and youknow that guy is no stranger to bigbarrels but uh you got a good point islike not only are people learningpipeline but they\\'re also having tolearn how to jump how to survive a wiout of pipeline like a lot of peoplehaven\\'t had that experience you knowthat\\'s something we don\\'t really thinkabout that much like okayit will that experience how do you getout of that position in good shape issomething you got to learn too it\\'salmost like if you charge absolutelyyour hardest you don\\'t get as in troubleas if you go like halfway out any littlehesit full speed half tank Full Throttleis better than you know full tankthrottle half throttle you know what Imean nobody really likes that I seen a Iseen Eevee Wong on screen earlieryawning and I\\'m like you better wake upnow girl it\\'s fly no time to sleep notime to sleep now we got uh 10 minutesshe\\'s got some time to get back outthere and get a wave um she\\'s definitelycharging replay there it is right herebeautiful Drop kind of late and thenside slipped which messed up her lineright there the wave the wave kind ofwent out to sea as well it\\'s kind of awhat we call a clamper you see it kindof shut down on the end right there alittle and got high it\\'s uh somethingyou got to watch out for is the angle ofthe wave when it comes in it might looklike this nice Tepe but if it\\'s comingacross the reef too much it\\'ll have thislike chandelier clamshell at the endinstead of one that has maybe a littletail on it that you know it\\'s going tocome at you and as it comes at you it\\'sgoing to you know make the wave throwand open up more some of those ones thatare very hard to take off on there\\'s areason you take off behind the barreland pull into the barrel instead ofdropping right on the peak becausesometimes they think oh I\\'m going todrop in on the peak but that\\'s thehardest place to drop in the worst placeto be really is at the peak yeah it\\'skind of funny and that\\'s changed a lotthough I think over the years where likeback back in like the old days not theold old days but where like people aregetting in early so they weren\\'t likethey weren\\'t taking off under the lipbut they\\'re getting in early and thatwas a little different thing where youdid want to kind of be at the peak butnow it\\'s like people are getting in latebehind it and that\\'s where you\\'re goingto get a good Barrel Malia kin Maka upand riding on a little right just up anddown but yeah I even changed some of myequipment to start looking more likethat old Derek Hull Jerry Style BS thatare thicker because those guys weregetting just as barreled if not morebarreled than the guys today and they\\'recoming from the outside big bottom turnsand Fading Into ho waves at the pipeMasters back in the day and like I meanjust those boards they would ride lookslike they\\'re getting so much easier yeahand it\\'s almost like everybody wanted togo smaller and more eag out and likemore upside down and sideways to whereyou know I was watching uh Ivan\\'s heatthe other day that or the Florence heatand uh that that one left Ian took offlike under like I saw a photo of itlater and he was like it was alreadylike this and he\\'s paddling standing upyou know I\\'m just like to even likethink that like oh I\\'m just going to goon this one you know I know he was justlike amped up or whatever but it wasjust like such a crazy position to be inspeaking of the Florence Brothers we gotanother heat coming up with all theFlorence Brothers in it again tell uslike what\\'s what\\'s their Dynamic arethey competitive and uh knowing eachother so well do they start usingtactics to uh get in each other\\'s headbefore we let John answer that questionwe are going to take a break here at theVans pipe Masters2023 right here on the beautifulNorthshore of Oahu Havi thank you allfor joining us today we\\'ll leave you atLura and of on thescreen my biggest fear about surfingpipe is my fear is more like notsucceeding like of course I\\'m scared ofthe wave and like scared of hitting thebottom but I never want my fears or mydoubts to hold me back from doingsomething that I think I can do I tendto be harder on myself so I just don\\'tlike think of this I\\'m more like okaywhat what do I want to do and how am Igoing to get there hitting the insectionat pipe makes me feel if it gives youthe opportunity go for it like Mason hoLanding an air on like a 7ft board atthe end section of like after gettingsuper Barrel is just so excitingwelcome back to one of the mostbeautiful views in the world one thatnever gets old the Drone shot from thevan pipe houses over to the lineup atPipeline on the fabled NorthShore ofOahu in Hawaii we are in round threeheat three and we got about 7 minutesleft um Moana is going to need a 19.4 tomove into the thir third play Spot justto protect that lead cuz the fourth playSpot keeps on changing yeah yeah everyheat it\\'s changing so she\\'s going towant to get another high score just tosecure her spot in the finals you don\\'twant to be sitting on that fourth spotwith more heat more heat coming up youcrossing your fingers you know if ifyou\\'re in heat five and you\\'re in thefourth spot and uh there\\'s no one afteryou it\\'s fine that\\'s fine but this isheat three there\\'s two more Heats ofvery very capable women coming up nowMoana Jones Wong really wants in sixminutes to be able to get one more scoreto add to her score line I me you seeright behind her there\\'s Bella KenworthyI mean there\\'s so many girls ready to gono Sierra just got out she\\'s done ohwhat about Gabriel uh Gabriel branGabriel Brian she\\'s still going she hasanother heat oh yes she does yeahinteresting that\\'s second change fastthat\\'s got to be stressful finishingyour heat and watching it\\'s so differentthis format where you\\'re seeing likeyou\\'re not you\\'re not losing but you\\'relike you can get knocked back out evenafter you\\'ve made it into that positionthink I think it\\'s awesome because everyevent snowboarding all the other actionsports are kind of like that it\\'s notreally a single elimination me versusyou it\\'s like you get to keep comingback and watch your favorite Surfer surfuntil the finals right it\\'s like it\\'salmost like sometimes you get rid ofhalf your viewership when you when yousend your Surfer gets knocked out andall of a sudden there\\'s a heat thatdoesn\\'t have waves oh he\\'s not the bestanymore why cuz the waves just suck forthat 20 minutes you know what I mean sothis is the kind of a format thateverybody gets to perform perform andlike Nathan said perform in alldifferent conditions and see all thefaces of Pipeline and you\\'re no strangerto pipeline I mean you surf out here anduh your boards it\\'s been a while justhappen to be uh under the feet of someof the greatest pipeline Surfers I meanyou got the Florence boys you got mybrother Kaa is the bread sck a realmodelI hope I hope CO\\'s watchingthis finally broke him quick recap ofthis heat there was a one of moana\\'sbiggerscores that was her18 got such great style yeah she\\'s sicklook at this thing oh oh that was Sophiebill just charging again ringing thebell Dam that looks a lot like jal\\'s huhthat\\'s what I said that\\'s it\\'s jumped inthe same spot this is here Moana again abomb beautiful wave who\\'s that MoanaLopez Jones Wongyeah perfect position coming in from thecold look at this girl look at that spitshe was somehow she always matches herred jersey with her little red helmetynice Al there\\'s backup score right heredragging across dragging the arm nicepositioning and here\\'s the bell ringerrighthere oh she got almost like jumped intothe lip you know like at the the movieNorthshore when it says when the wavebreaks here don\\'t be there that\\'s kindof one moment one of those she put rightthere when the wave breaks here don\\'tdon\\'t be there yeah don\\'t intentionallyput yourself there cuz that\\'s what\\'s youyou\\'re going to uh what is it you\\'regoing to hit thereef no yeah the wave breakes here don\\'tbe there or you\\'re going to get drilledare you going to get drilled or you\\'regoing to get drilled that\\'s the line Cyou\\'re so hly you don\\'t even know you\\'rehly such a c classic I was in that movieyou were you I\\'m Chandler\\'s son yeah noway oh yes that\\'s epic when they throwthe sticks go get it Rex walking outlittle kid I remember uh Al oh Zoe ohzoeee going for a snap that looks like apisel right there yes it does uh she\\'snot getting the wave she wants that\\'sfor sure oh these waves have barely beencoming Moana Jones have been on thepretty much the only real scorable wavesyou know she\\'s kind of sat there tookher spot she she\\'s got the hours inthere more than anyone else in this heatfor sure yeah almost look like zoy washunting some rights there were somerights that came in earlier anduh and what do you think you thinkanybody\\'s going to disrupt this top fourright here I think we got who\\' you seeGabby Bryan is coming in I think ifthere was more rights I would think thatshe has a great chance um I haven\\'treally seen her backside tube ridingthat much but um I don\\'t know this is apretty solid like grouping right therelike those would have to be thefavorites we Frankie Herrera we gotFrankie Herrera out there with some somesmooth ones she\\'s coming up in the nextHeat she\\'s got a real good chance cuzshe\\'s got a high score already was whatshe got two 17s in her first heat Ididn\\'t see her second heat did she havea higher score than that I\\'m not surebut it looks like uh the waves aresuited perfectly for her surfing espe weseen lately yeah she\\'s sick that a latedrop into the Barrel in uh yeah day oneyeah that was nice that was one of thenicer ways it\\'s cool to see mom thereshe\\'s a mom and she\\'s getting waves outthere so she needs she needs one of them29 Point almost a perfect wave to crackthe top four or better her two waves soshe can either replace her two you knowlower scores or get one high score of a29.7 which is definitely doable todaythere\\'s tens out there that\\'s possiblethat that\\'s going to be a tall orderthough cuz I think the highest scorewas what was that a couple Heats ago wasa 29.5 is that Molly I think it wasMolly get for that one backside Barrel29 I think it was a 29 sick she was kindof like had that little look up likepump it was a 29.4 I stand correctedexcuse me we were wrong by one tenth ofa point excuse us we make mistakes we\\'rehuman we like to keep it accurate aspossible here

they\\'re lookingback likeha we\\'ve all done it it we\\'ve all doneitoh Kelly Slater\\'s the master sing guyson waves likethat it\\'suh it is really awesome to have someonemiked up not too many times you get tohear the sales pitch in acontest sales pitch though I wonder ifthat was like it must have been likecoko or Lura sending her on that one forsure she bought it thoughdoesn\\'t look like it\\'s going to affecther too much though cuz she\\'s right outthe back and in position already thatwas actually good to to get thebutterflies and the bugs out right offthe bat with nothing else coming get outthere shank it out a bitand I knew it we have Laura ener withthe mic saleswoman of the[Laughter]Year oh that would be cool to see howmany of those you could put together ohlike a little Montage like go go broyeah this one you\\'re on this one andthen show the actual waves that thepeople catch and people send them onwaves that\\'ll be alltime well here we go talking aboutselling it or sending it Laura on theleft lookingPinchy andCoco coming out oh come on sister thatwould have been a hugescore a missed opportunity there for Mrskokoo who\\'s really good on selling metrash waves was Andy and Bruce when wewere growing up they were always doingthe Hard Sell on the worst wave yeah cuzthey were never giving away the good oneso for sure anyone they told you to goon was going to be a junk one oh yeahand then they and they loveed seeing youwipe out they loved watching me wipe outfor their for their entertainment wasthat one and if I didn\\'t go on the wavesthey would say you know they would giveme a hard time like ah you w out so Ireally had no choice yep once upon atime so that\\'s what big brothers do toyou no it\\'s Brotherly Love they make youtough they made me tough for sure on thelast exchange these girls should not betaking on off on these waves well on theleft this right and still it\\'s Pinchyright now there\\'s waves that can takeyou to the next level and those wavesthat size of wave today is just notgoing to do it like even if you getbarreled on that wave cool but you gotto get a score in the 20s now to I meanif you want if you\\'re comparing yourselfto what\\'s been going on the score scoresWise It\\'s like watching Shawn White doget a 90o run and then you think oh I\\'lljust do a you know 70 point round bu allright you\\'re not winning like that yougot to go and wait this contest is thiscontest is the perfect format so thatyou can relax get out there and choosethe one because right now in your thirdround it really doesn\\'t matter if youget a bunch of 17s and 18s no they\\'renot that\\'s not going to be in your topif it\\'s not a eighto score looking waveor above there\\'s absolutely no reasonyou should be catching it unless youwant to just sit around and watch thefinals and have at all these little onesand you will be cheering from thesidelines right yeah they\\'re going toneed some scores in the 20 point rangeI\\'m thinking 25 25 and up 25 27 and upright now especially with the scoresthat we havenow I meane Wong definitely needs uh two morescores you know 22 is right there buteverybody you know the top girls havewhat they have 22 27 23 24 22 29 20 2125 17 18 28 like if you don\\'t have uh 28or higher 275 or higher in your scoreline somewhere you\\'re probably not goingto advance and right there we see Ithink the only Surfer that can get onescore andstilladvance and right here on your screen wehave the queenherself Moana Jones Wong on on the beachwith h Moana well done for starters uhI\\'ve asked this question to the last twoHeats in a row you\\'ve moved up intofourth place on the leader board do youthink it\\'s going to be enough to getinto the final I don\\'t know like sarrawas just in fourth and then I justknocked out of fourth and I\\'m in fourthI wanted to be like rather in like thirdthen I\\'d feel more safe but I don\\'treally feel super safe right now so Ihope I may it to the finals I hope I canhold on to this fourth spot yeah me tooI\\'m K to watch and uh how different doesThis Thing feel to other comps you\\'vedone here it\\'s different because it\\'slike I think it\\'s harder actuallybecause it\\'s like you can improve andkeep improving and everybody keepsimproving so it just gets harder andharder all right beautiful thank youwelldone well there you have it thank youHolly thank youMo and uh check out this replay this isthe wave that got her in that for a spotthat\\'s an absolute jiner she knew itwhen she came out hands high that wasenough and uh right now we have thesegirls just absolutely chomping at thebit right behind her and eeve Wong coulddo it with a pair of 20s I thinksomething like that could maybe uh gether up into that uh coveted Fort spotwell she\\'s holding on to a pair of sixesand she\\'s going to definitely want toreplace those low scores well you needyou need64.5 to get in so she she\\'s got to gettwo she\\'s got 23 she\\'s got to get two21s to getthere um and that is 21 across the boardmeaning seveno ride by each judgeadd it up totally possible which istotally possible if there\\'s waves I\\'mnot sure if I tripped on the court orone of these girls forgot to put moneyin the machine before they went out butit is totallyflat well what\\'s the forecast 0 toeight we still got 20 minutes leftthough so they gottime they got time we as competitorsknow how fast 20 minutes can go by in aheat or how slow it is when uh you knowyou\\'re leading and uh somebody needs asmall score and that clock is tickingdown and you just want to click downtick down as fast as possible so you canmake it through the Heat and you\\'rewatching the other person praying to Godthey don\\'t get thatscore at that time in those times I feellike the the clock is painfullyslow yeah you\\'re right right when uhit\\'s you who\\'s up against theropes trying to get teed off on you justhope the bell rings and and here we gooh like I said hair it\\'s that wave justshut down ah she didn\\'t make it off thebottom anyway she just barely made itinto the barrel late drop beautiful shetraveled for a second there but she wastoo far to the bottom of the wave and OhWhat a Beautiful attempt by Frankienonetheless I\\'m and she was right theredropped in just barely got under thelip and all that turbulence there didn\\'thave the speed to keep up to finish offthatride but she\\'s right there K I meanshe\\'s knocking on the door yeahdefinitely see everybody sitting out theback just waiting forthat big beautifulBarrel oh oh yeah you know Lauraaniverse going to give it a goal she\\'sgot to replace all threescor Laura\\'s got to replace all threescores Laura\\'s got to get busyyeah when you\\'re in that position that\\'snot the time to just wait around youhave to start building sixes is goodsixes sevens and you get a 10 or a nineyou got to just kind of build thatup anduh right now if I was Lura I\\'d bethinking like am I going to have enoughtime to get three big scores you knowwith the lws she\\'s got to she\\'s got tostrategize really good here to make sureshe\\'s got enough time to get three goodwaves she needs three strategy oneshould be catch the best wave you can asquick as possible is isn\\'t that always astrategy though strategy too catch thenext best wave as quick as possiblestrategy three rinse and rinse andrepeat rinse and repeatwell well now that we have a l in theaction we will be right back thank youfor sticking around with us on finalsday here at Vans pipe Masters2023 Mahalo newo and I\\'ll see you soon Ilive right like one song away from pipeor like a half a song by the time you\\'repulling up to pipe or like you\\'repassing Sunset it\\'s almost you hear likethe guitar like barely tickling inyou\\'re like who am I psyching am I waand then you start getting and by thetime you\\'re at pipe it\\'s just like likejust starting the Wailing and then youcould just pull up and sit in your carfor a minute like oh I\\'mpsyching I hope someone sees me oheveryone\\'s there everyone sees me what\\'sup time remember Uncle drick he us toblast his jams too so I just take mytime aminute once again welcome back for thoseof you who just joined us we are here onfinals day it looks like we had a riderduring the break it looks like FrankieHerrera hucked herself on another wavethere on your screen you can see allthat white water you can tell that a sethas come through and look at the textureon the water I tell you right in Alkiala when that trade win kicks in withthis size lurchy swell we are going tosee some amazing acrobatics tumblingdown thesewaves we\\'ve already seen a few that thiswind just makes it that much more fun towatch I know a stiff offshore likereally holds the barrels up makes themreally Hollow but I find sometimes thatthat wind coming up the face can justhold hang you up at the top a littlemore yeah which can cause some prettydramatic wipeouts you just got to dig that muchharder and sometimes you know the sprayis like blowing in your face you\\'retaking offblind oh yeah and uh looks like we mighthave some waves moving the wind islooking perfect right now I mean look atthat shape of that wave now all we needis somesets the girls getting into position Imean look at how beautiful that water isjust spittingbarrels if you want it you can get ittoday at the van pipe Masters the swellis on the rise good call by contestdirector Nathan fler two more Heats ofwomen or one more heat of women and awomen\\'s final so after this next Heatnot this heat the next one there will bea twom man a two Heats of men and then afinals Frankie Herrera again that willnot be the one oh that\\'s a beautifulBarrel nonetheless[Music]yes but uh just missing that beginningpart of that waveum beautifully surfed beautiful wave Ijust think that to get into that top twoshe\\'s going to need a wave you drop infrom behind the peak pull in the barrellike she did the other day so Archcoming through and I really think rightnow the big scores and the reason I saidthat\\'s not the one is because the bigscores are going to be coming from thatoutside section pulling in off the dropyou know she came around it nicelyperfect positioning got a little Barrelbut you see on your screen29.7 is what she needs to advance youeither cut that in half or you get thatone timemhm so uh whatever she\\'s got has to beatwhatever scores are on her score linerightnow and it looks like she\\'s got a lowscore of a seven she definitely is goingto want to replace and then she\\'sholding on to 217so let\\'s look at the replace no matterwhat it\\'s going to replace that seveny little inside Barrel you see on thatoutside if she could have got her railin the water right here is kind ofbouncy see how she kind of projects outshe would have got the tuck into thatfirst part and then come through thatBarrel that would have been very highscore yes right have knifed it rightinto the barrel instead of dropping downto the bottom of those are one of thoseyou have to hug the wall they call itwhen you stand up and you put one or twoof your arms in and you stall yourselflet the wave throw over you and then youstart pumping through those sectionsthere\\'s a couple different ways you cansurf those waves you know come out drawa line out to the bottom like she didbottom turn sneak into the pit or youcan try and hold yourself as long aspossible up at the top while it throwsover and then start pumping throughthose sections right yeah that would beideal Franky herrerEevee Wong kokoo and Lauraener all looking to try and get a spotin the top four of ourleaderboard right now Frankie herrer hasthe best chance she now has 56points we\\'re going to go and check inwith Laura on the Red Bull water miknow

takingthat nasty spillFrankie definitely charging to Laura aswell they\\'re Koko got how\\'s that n onethat Coco just got yeah Imean pushing themselves over the ledgethe one that KOCO went on back door andlook at this groom Pizza magic an heobviously want some piece ofthis startnow the wind is grooming the land isheating up trades are filling ingrooming the surface of thewave yeah it\\'s this swell is filling inquickly what are our expectations uhfrom the forecast for those who are justjoining us we\\'re seeing that the anincomingfreshly Northwest well is coming in longperiod eWong wow trying to take a big droptrying to stick it oh a very bad placeto fall looking at back door trying tojust stick the airdrop sliding offlanding something happened maybe hit herface she\\'s now some blood looks like shehit her headoh you see her being attended toyeah I think she might haveum hit obviously hit the reef I mean howshallow is it when you when you\\'refalling on a 68ft wave there oh it\\'sshallow it\\'s it\\'s just less than four 4feet 4T deep less uh shallower than howtall she is for sure and that thatconsistency of reef is just like it\\'slike landing on concrete oh yeah it\\'sbut again there\\'s there\\'s not a lot oflive reef there but those little piecesof live reef that are there they\\'rereally Jagged and sharp so you could bein that unlucky situation of justhitting that tiny little coral reef orthat coral paa Coral Colony there at theback door and that could easily justwith the power of moving across it\\'slike you know a paper cut you cutyourself imagine a liveCoral well we will uh hope that she uhis able torecover see her being tended to by ourmedical staff in thisheat I mean just a bunch of incredibleSurfers BethanyHamilton who is just an allaroundcharger remember at cloudbreak back in2016 uh she got a third place loves toscratch into big big waves towed intoJaws Etc uh speaking of of of chargingFrankie her just throwing herself off

had her daughter she findsherself wanting to charge even harder uhand maximize herperformancescan we talk about how Anthony wal Walshwasstanding side conversation what wasgoing on over there pipeline not nostranger to pipeline all right nowlisten this is the fifth and Final Roundopportunities to change the game andmake it into the final you see Annie andBethany in that 16 and 17 spot but foryoung Bella Kenworthy and GabrielGabrielle O\\'Brien a little bit less workto do for them in the ninth and seventhspot you know what a great story BellaKenworthy is at just 16 years of age youknow she had sort of a a fear mindsetthat she had to get over when it comesto pipeline when she first got theinvitation she kind of left the messageon red like she was like o I don\\'t knowher team manager actually had to respondfor her um since she\\'s gotten here she\\'sbeen in the water non-stop she said shestarted to get some waves last year thatmade her feel a little bit morecomfortable but again pipe it this is awave it\\'s different from any other wavein the world and making the choice thatI okay I\\'m going to actually buildrelationship with it means that you\\'regoing to go through some things yeahtotally this isn\\'t an easy dance so tospeak out here at pipeline Bethany laydropwell look like she was able to get outof the way of her board and she camedown also under wow that was kind of ashe\\'s under for a moment with theGoPro see that again Bethany reallytrying to give it a dig standing up laydropwall almost kicked the board away alittle bit when she knew she wasn\\'tgoing to makeit yeah Bethany having a a go at itstill here at the Vans Pipeline Masterswe\\'ve watched her grow up from such ayoung age so many accolades now motherof four as we see Annie do Santos Anniewhoa big drop kind of quite engaged atra originally from Rio De JaneiroBrazil lives in Sunrise Sunrise BeachAustralianow she was an alternate she had an Alalternate spot for last year was wasunable to get in so she\\'s psychedto be able to have this opportunitywe\\'re joining us now special guest herein the booth the one and only noDean Noah welcome to the booth Che is inthe hall stoked to here how fired upwere you when you saw what wasdeveloping this morning pretty fired upand then I had a coffee and then I gotnervous kind of stock standard alwayshappens I think once you paddle out youkind of get rid of that I don\\'t knowwatching it from the beach um kind ofmakes you freak out every time how longdo you watch it before padding out areyou from what I seen a lot of times youkind of just get up grab your stuff andjust get out there yeah I mean I\\'mpretty sure I just sit around at thehouse all day watching it and probablyburned myself out but I think kind ofwatch it for a while and then just rightbefore you go out you kind of got tojust stop watching it for 20 minutes orelse you just I don\\'t know you just sofocused on it and looking at how good itis you I don\\'t know kind of it roast youyou know talk yourself in circles y forsure looks like you got some pretty goodwaves so far you saw your Northshorecampay off pretty good or was that likea back door off the- wall a couple ofthem right when you first came yeah hada couple um it was real crowded and justgot lucky getting a few straight up andthat\\'s pretty much all all I want to dowhen I come over here is get a few wavesand I\\'m kind of already stoked out soanything that I get in the combo or notis abonus yeah it\\'s it\\'s interesting to seewhat what\\'s everyone riding what\\'s yourtake on it it seems like you have apretty your your boards don\\'t seem toopinned out seems like they\\'remaneuverable you\\'re you definitely nomatter how heavy it\\'s getting you stillwant to get a bit of release on it isthere a a thought process to that yeah Ithink when I know that I might be goinguh right I\\'ll probably try and ride alittle bit shorter board it\\'s kind offunny because the I feel like I want toride a 68 for the left but then as soonas I get a right on a 68 unless you\\'vetaken off in the right spot you likecould be too big but when you\\'re in aheat you get to take off in a bit betterspot so that kind of changes everythingyou can kind of ride exactly what youwant in the Heat and I think sometimesprobably in the free s i ride a littlebit too small a board but you kind ofgot to make that in between guess youknow seems like there\\'s been a battlebetween Channel Islands andwhat was um what were the top boardsagain Channel Islands and pisel pel yeahand then there\\'s some dhds in there JsJs but what what are you on coming outhere uh I ride LSD and from seemed to beworking yeah those first couple of dayswhen it was big in wobbly I was riding aquad too which is weird for me wow butum uh been riding quite a little bitlately really yeah how\\'s that how\\'s thatgoing if I find like when you get whenit gets Pinchy or tight you can kind ofjust ride straight through it and thenwhen you\\'re too deep which is a lot ofthe time out here in a freeer I feellike you\\'re always taking off in thewrong spot oh my God little splitPeak bany just getting who did tossedtwice did a to come out of the whitewater on that thing I don\\'t know thatshould be some points just making thatdrop and getting thesafety have a look on the replay what isit uh Noah about where you\\'refrom that makes it so that you guyslike like manners and and Russell holdon let\\'s have a lookhere whatoh she did well getting out in front ofthat thing that could have endedbadly that was a legit airdrop that feels nice when you get in abad spot like that and you can get outof theresafely I\\'msurejust Po and over yeah what is it aboutwhere you\\'re from yeah I think um butyou and V like yeah what\\'s going on downthere just the whole of Oz I thinkthere\\'s a bit of a Melting Pot of peoplewho just love suring real cooked wavesand I know I mean Ross is insane andhe\\'s kind of the leader of the parkreally and then obviously Sean and meand Harry and S St together and we alljust kindof I don\\'t know share love for heaviersort of waves and and sponge gottenpushed yeah it seems like there\\'re aheavy on the body a little bit too it\\'spretty funny but a lot of the waves thatyou surf down there are our waves thatwere were were sponge waves first yeahyeah for sure and now now we all kind ofjust Ser them together and that it\\'s uma lot of people just are happy to surfwith each other down there so it\\'spretty sick good push in the water itdoes seem to be a bituh there\\'s there\\'s a few breaks that itseems they\\'re allowed to share with theworld and then there\\'s quite a ton ofwaves that it\\'s for you folks we talkabout Pik Club yeah yeah there\\'sdefinitely some secretive stuff downthere for sure which is cool you got tohave that looked like Bethany Hamiltonmade a switch in equipment maybe a maybea longer board yeah I wonder with thatlonger interval again there they\\'removing so fast yeah it looks like youwant a bit of board out there I reckonso you can at least take off a bitfurther out and yeah yeah I took 14minutes and 3 seconds yesterday to watchRussell bur\\'s new edit and it\\'sridiculous I was I was I was traumatizedoh yeah I think everyone that\\'s watchedit so far has definitely being leftscratching their head after that rightit\\'s insane do you surf a bunch of thosewavesyourself um a couple of them I thinkmost ly though he was surfing an irandin that thing and um I\\'ve surfed shipStones before but not anything like thatI was[Music]stupid the last wave of the last thelast wave of the edit if you haven\\'twatched it yet it\\'s up on stab folkslike that last wave will just make yourethink your whole life ah I know Ithink there\\'s about six of them in a rowat the end where I was just going whatis going on here this well dude let\\'snot forget about your film release lastyear sure Nas I mean that thing wasfilled with technical Barrel riding uhso much so that uh a good friend ThomasCampbell reached out and said check thisout oh sick and you know like a lot oftimes uh you wonder who\\'s the audiencethat\\'s watching and Thomas Kell that\\'sjust he\\'s a snob he\\'s not he\\'s nottelling he\\'s not telling you to watchjust anything so that\\'s a deal it kindof is if you I don\\'t know if you know t-monk but he definitely has a very um avery developed and uh specific aestheticand pallet for surfing that if if youget something from teimo to watch yousaid it\\'s so much better thanme you you\\'re watching it you knowbecause he doesn\\'t watch things yeah andhe\\'s deep in the Redwood Forest makingart and working on his films yeah hesounds cool so yeah it was it was coolto see that your your performance uhtransmitted across broad audiences sodon\\'t don\\'t not give yourself the creditthat I think you deserve in yourtechnicality I think you got to keepReinventing yourself on yourself to keepstoked on it instead of just doing thesame thing over and over againso no I I I admire you making umchoosing to make that kind of contentespecially as things are becoming moreand more disposable totally via you knowthe gram and the talk uh to be like nowe\\'re going to make some stuff thatstill can get people\\'s attention and canbetimeless here we are some from nzdwow how long was the process making thisso this is mash my new one I made itafter Noz and um basically it was a yearand it kind of came together prettyquickly which normally it takes a whileor re longer to make something that\\'s 46minutes but um yeah we kind of got ittogether pretty quick and it was meantto just be a few leftover clips and thenwe ended up getting some SE waves for itso we go Bethy Bethy God it\\'s so scarywhen that happens going over youroutside rail is the worst thing everyeah we\\'ve been talking about thatearlier worst thing to watch dude youwouldn\\'t wish it on someone you\\'ddislike no you know I I almost wonderwhen in the ASM world if people want tostart making that outside rare a littlethicker or something so does want tolike catch like a safety training littlekickstand yeah I feel like oh what\\'sthis next ondoing it\\'s pretty hard tolike oh that wassick nice jop it\\'s hard to like surfpipe when the sw\\'s coming up foreveryone cuz if you\\'re not in the rightspot it\\'s definitely a good chance ofgetting smoked or not getting bed yeahand um whowow let\\'s go let\\'s go let\\'s go yes thatwas sick good job Annie do SantosI I mean like every wave you see thismorning most of them have pretty scarydrops yeah like it\\'s definitely notperfect and the women have beenanswering the call all morning justcharging oh yeah it\\'s actuallyinsane look at this thing wowdisconnected that was realsick I would have been stoked on thatyeah I think that\\'s what we\\'ve beensaying all morning any of these waves wewould beshe did really good to just slow downjust enough too yeah cuz if you try getto deep then you unless you\\'re behindthat bit there which is so hard to beyou\\'re not going to make it out of theend bit before it closes out yeah it\\'s afine line between getting real tubed andnot making it well it\\'s also too with aan empty lineup on Pipeline that\\'s likecan be a little bit rattling too to beif you\\'re not surfing it if you don\\'thave a really close relationship with itagain not quite getting in there ifyou\\'re out there by yourself you\\'relooking around you\\'re like wait where ismy lineups I usually know someonethey\\'re in the spot you play off ofpeople I think too when it\\'s when theSWS just started it feels like it breaksall a lot closer in and further down theline than probably when it\\'s more linedup it\\'s probably breaking out furtherand kind of all over the reef but rightnow it seems like it\\'s kind of just bigwall walls and you kind of got to takeoff on the end of it which makes it realhard because it\\'s not a big peig whereyou can kind of back door it well that\\'swhat\\'s I think interesting again I\\'m notthe I don\\'t call the I don\\'t callanything but you look at the contestyou\\'re like okay the swell stillbuilding do we give the Women\\'s Firstlater there there is no matter whatthere\\'s still going to be a distinctionbetween men and women right now untilit\\'s heat backto back men women menwomen men women they\\'re still going tohave to be making calls and this goingto be a little bit ofbias right now in my mind a rising swelllong period conditions are groomed thisis thegnarlier yeah you probably be right insaying that like it might get biggerlater but if the SWR starts cleaning upand it kind of settles is coming inslower and hitting it it\\'s probably morechill than what\\'s going on right nowyeah especially for new lineups for alot of these women that have never seenempty lineups out pipe I mean I\\'m sureyou know what\\'s it like in thesecontests when you\\'re out here atpipeline when you I mean you w the Aroheat that\\'s for sure every time I Idon\\'t know every time I get in a compI\\'m I\\'m either like one the third heatbecause it somehow is always cooking orjust the end of the day oh my God yeahthings moving waves are moving so fastfeels like the more sun that gets on itthe better it gets out here yeah I don\\'tknow why but must do something with theWindgood to see Bella pop up thereyeah oh Bethany just getting underneaththat one look at that thing it\\'sdeceivingly beautiful when you look atit from above you\\'re like oh that\\'s fulldoable that looks doesn\\'t look anywherenear as big even on the replays from inreal life you look at these things inreal life back it looks like two threefoot bigger when you\\'re watching it inreal life than on the Replay forsure as wesee WilliamBillykeer about to paddle out first heat hewas riding a 68 whichwas for him is pretty big out here umbut again with that broken metatarso hejust wanted his body to doless might be on a 66 rightnowum so we\\'re speaking of um stainlimber Billy doing a bunch of umexercises Noah oh yeah what\\'s yourflexibility about I don\\'t know cuz we\\'rewe\\'rehearing you\\'re you\\'re insanely flexibleyeah I guess so um I don\\'t know I do alittle bit of yoga not too much thoughcouple times aweek that\\'s a lot for some people yeahit\\'s hard to concentrate but okay waitwait let\\'s roll this back I thinkcuz when I hear yoga I think UncleJerry and you\\'re telling me brother Noahyou\\'re out here yeah Irishyoga justkidding line of the day line of the dayoh n n you got to I don\\'t know you can\\'tyou can\\'t just do nothing especiallywhen you get get a bit older especiallywhen you\\'re chucking yourself in the allsorts of death slab pits like you guyssort of live for like at a certain pointyour body\\'s like natural ability ain\\'tgoing to cut it yeah I think I think thething it does most to is like I shoulddo it way more but it feels like it kindof brings it in the present moment getsyou off your phone death scrolling youknow yeah so that\\'s nice so are we goingto see a noad uh gym setup at the housefull weight rack a whole deal is thatcomingsoon another kind of rack Maybe[Laughter]are oh ohBethany couldn\\'t quite find the yeahbetter than going over the falls againyeah I reckon you definitely get moreconfidence from not nose Ian yeah yeahcan get in your head pretty hard if youkeep putting the nose under on a couplewow and really late dropping I mean thisis the some of those ones were prettybad waves that kind of not tubing andbut you still got I mean you\\'re in aheat you still got to try you never knowyeah you\\'re trying to get into the finalagain Stakes are high in this heat fiveespecially forGabriella Brian and Bella Kenworthy orjust a few spotsout of being able to shake things upwith Moana JonesWong sitting in that four spot on thebubble she\\'s like please I like yougirls but just keep it chill yeah forsure yeah you\\'ve been out here no you\\'vebeen competing on at pipe for quite along time right I think coms for surewhat was that I don\\'t know if youremember maybe it was your first PipePro they were calling you Newport Noah Ithink remember that it was in the shootout I waslike this guNewport class okay yeah how would youdescribe your relationship with uh withwithpipeline pretty good I think I\\'m prettyscared of the wave that\\'s Healy yeah ohhere we go Bethy yeah that one was scaryyeah that was her first one she so deepand late and still committed and luckyenough to kick out Annie with these laydrops she\\'s like L dropAnnie how\\'s this one that was scarytoo those are allprobably oh oh man this is like Carnageheat yeah that was some brutal wife outsin that heat I mean they know this islike their last that was sick yeah andfrom the back you get the theperspective of how critical that wavewas yeah I think it shows the size a bitbetter when you leave it in front of itor frombehind man they\\'re sending it they wantit they\\'re like this is my last chancethey got 2 minutes at that finals localbody workers are going to be busy afterbacked up for sure it\\'s going to be hardto get appointmentsyeah even when the cloud comes over alittle bit it just gets a little bitmore scary yeah yeahright you want the sun all over ittotally well if it was a single scoreGabriella would as you see on yourscreen looking for a 27.7 Bella a 29those would be amongst the highest wavesuh scored for the women in all threerounds I was kind of shocked on moana\\'suh score I thought she was going to geta little bit uh I thought so too notshocked but think relative to I thinkthe 29 and the 209.5 that we\\'d seen from Molly and Aaronand Aaron yeah I think maybe becausethat they thought it I guess it startedcooking then so they were kind ofkeeping it open but they probably couldhave went a bit bigger it was prettyskits I think yeah yeah I think when itgets bigger too it opens up when thebarrel gets bigger it\\'s hard todetermine maybe she just made it look abit easy to she really did though I meaneven that take off I feel like you canget maybe sometimes people get cruedwithout thinking maybe they could do abit more because they made it look soeasy yeah I mean she has this way thatshe gets to her feet like so quicklythat she almost looks like she Glides inon really critical waves mhm butyeah so it looks like right now in thecurrent top four there are threeprevious Vans pipe Masters yeah WanaCarissaMolly a possibility of a of a two-timefirst or young Aaron Brook Brooks couldjust be like give me that she\\'s notafraid yeah I mean pretty tripping onwhat she\\'s up to I like when she comesout and slams a turn too that backhandone especially 16 pretty heavy so we gotyou know what do you who do you thinkwho do you got for the women\\'sfinal I think I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s goingto get bigger and all lefts and fromwhat I\\'ve seen I\\'m probably going to gowith either Moana or Molly and I\\'m kindof 50/50 on just whoever has a betterheat cuz Molly\\'s pretty nuts right andCH really crazy and I think both of themare actually hunting to get deep and notjust catching waves and survivingthey\\'re pretty up there so well saidMoana too I mean can\\'t she\\'s the best soit\\'ll be one of them too I reckon wellour final is setCarissa Moore Mollypicklum young Aaron Brooks and MoanaJones Wong three Champs and a possiblefirst in Aaron and congratulations toall 20 women in their performances overthe last three days and I think it\\'spretty safe to say that we we once againwatched the entirety of the of womensurfing get moved way into the future atthis event bunch of SE rides that I seenI was very impressed killer Noah thankyou so much bro excited to see your heatand see some magic out there good luckwith the nerves yeah I\\'ll try to get ridof himsome for to get out there a little yog alittle yoga in the back and yeah you\\'llbe good to go hopefully on the beach notin the water yeah yeah exactly all rightwell good luck today and have fun thanksfor stopping by appreciateitmoving into the men\\'s absolute Legend ohyeahNoah insanestyle and here weare the the the men have just beenchomping all morning long watching thewomen set the standard and uh big thingsahead every single Surfer has without ashadow of a doubt studied theleaderboard know the scores that existand know the scores that they need as wehave J Quinny Justin quintal Billy keerIMI colani devault and kaai King who uhgraced us with his presence in heatto Billy keer with that big score fromday one at pipeline of a24.80 he knows uh that uhjust one score could be a hugedifference for him he\\'s sitting on a7.60 and a12.50going to beselective who\\'s thiseite GoPro in mouth ohoh no wow that was a good effort towardsthe very end the wave just s that himout I thought there was going to be adog door Billy bil Barrel broken footBilly I got four kids tofeed oh Attitude Change attitude he likeI was all what one way about now he\\'slike I\\'m I\\'m forever heting he\\'s gonnabe sinking the teeth into it today hecan smell it he really really wants tobe in thefinal you know looking back at Billy\\'swave u in the on the smaller day doingthose turns I was uh speaking to ShayPerkins and we were talking about theway Billy has been ohgreat drop and kind of he\\'s likestalling and then stepping on the gasjust shifter card still on he was doingfull shifter cut in there he Sid fromfirst to third gear installing thenletting go riding the foam ball and thatwas technical had the wave and just givehim that off The Sandbar just shut himdown but looking at Billy we\\'re talkingand oh I was thatdrop Billy is maximizing that efficiencyyou know knowing that he has an injurynot trying to waste any energy and indoing so it seems to be really puttinghim in a great positionto wow so deep yeah I I wish it I\\'d liketo find out what length he\\'s on todaylike I said 68 before normally he ridesa 6\\'4 out here might have gone with the66 but that wavewas just technical all the things thatthe judges look for and eat up and againthat that local knowledge you know andhaving the ability to beprecisely selective and knowing what heneeds and he doesn\\'t need much justneeds a 12.4 to throw himself into thetopfour but with the whole field coming inbehind him he wants way more than thatguaranteed or garens if you will he\\'sgoing to get that and then some on thisscoreyeah we\\'re going to see where that putshim being the first seat that is a bitnerve-wracking as well um just becauseyou\\'rethe you\\'re the first one you have toeveryone will now know what they needafter you so you\\'re trying to do yourbest you\\'re going in blind trying to getthe biggest best wave you can all rightwell you you saw the women\\'s format forthe day and how it played out let\\'s takea look at how things are going to rollfor the men to get into thefinal[Music]he[Music]$100,000 gross and and and and theability to add your nameto historical figures within the sportof Surfing that have won uh this Vanspipe Master there is a Prestige and alegacy with being able to call yourselfa pipe master and for lifethat\\'s what I think is you can see$100,000 that\\'s a great incentive but tobe called a pipeline Master amongst youlook at the year you won with the peoplewho were invited with you that\\'s againthat\\'s a lifetimeKai charging for his charger chargingfor his chargeroutstanding um ka\\'s bidding for adodged dodg chargeroh and allfinal who Billy scores just in Billykeer with his wave just propelled him tonumber one on the leaderboard boom toldyou kid knew what he needed and what hewanted and Billy keer is our overallleader Quinny coming in smooth styletrying to find thetube people are really taking advantageof the pencildive I feel that wasn\\'t quite a thingbefore it\\'s nice to see people takingnotes yeah and learning how to get outof Harm\\'s Way that part it\\'s not justfor Aesthetics it\\'s literally for safetyyeah uh Justin Quinny J Quinny uh a aliving legend longboard worldchampion from Florida and he\\'s he\\'sstarted off as a shortboard as a kid andhe said he started longboardingspecifically just so he could surf moreas you seeKa pulling up and under but he\\'s sendingit look at that technique he just getswallowedup Jquenny went for a bit longer board hereoff the bottom and seeing no thank youI\\'m out of here he really loves surfingPipeline and he Compares he Comparestube riding to nose riding cuz he saidnose riding you\\'re basically gettingbarreled and he he feels like if you cannose ride well it gives you anopportunity to be able to play in thebarrel I mean look at the this year\\'sWorld Champion longboard Champion kaisAlis uh an incredible tube Rider on thelongboard uh back door andpipeline Jay quiny got he\\'s got a greatquote he says pipeline is like a toxicrelationship you just can\\'t get awayfrom it every time you want to turn yourback it\\'s just right there calling yourname and breathing down your backyeah stillthere now we\\'re getting into this veryinteresting part of that\\'s make thisformat so unique right would think aboutit after day one we had MikeyFebruary uh safe in that top spot andthen in Came John John to be like I\\'lltake it from here now if you looking atthe leaderboard Mikey has slid intothird place of course he still got uh aheat to go but uh the big question whoamongst the top four right now is Billyjust slid into the top spot uh is goingto be in the final at the end of the dayif you couldpick the names that are definitely goingto be in there from this top four whowill itbe Imean it\\'s it\\'s a it\\'sa it\\'s hard I I don\\'t even know if Icould choose especially with the wavesthat we have this right now probablygoing to be a lot different by the timewe get to the final don\\'t get me wrongBilly\\'s wave right now so far itdeserves that it\\'s a it was incredibleridemhm is that going to be enough for todaywhen you got people like Mason ho whoare going to be grabbing all the brailsof the board in the barrel and throwingpieces and shakas Benji Benji doublestalling deep on balls Seth going upsidedown fins free drops on back door I Idon\\'t know Eli bar I mean matah oh yeahImean Billy said oh you think that\\'s notenough watch this he\\'s like gothis I got kids to feed four ofthem four ofthem oh and something backdoor I think those I think the cheersthat we heard from the beach wereprobably from Mimi wow and the and thedouble hands behind the back in thatclose out looked like a subtle claim soit\\'ll be interesting to see what justwent place what went downi and what hasbeen mostly a quiet back door thismorning I mean there is coach allright I mean that could be youknow oh let\\'s see let\\'ssee pumping in it oh[Laughter]oh let\\'s go oh he didn\\'t even need astraight he\\'s likewhat look at thatthingreminiscent that\\'s like Slater Vibeslike five sectionsyeah that was an exchange so Billy outhere\\'s on his left pullingin nice oneyeah wow that\\'s a great greatpositioning you know it\\'s almost one ofthose things you\\'re like w how likewe\\'re here in the hole looking at thescreens and then we see look at frombehind oh all the way to the drop lookat that perfect perfect split Peak soupmy favorite soup splitpeek oh Emi guarantee is getting blastedUPI about to make bigjumps in theleaderboard I want to see that waveagain you can\\'t see that waveenough woo waiting on scores huge scorehuge has to be has to be 29 28 29 wasthat the best wave of the comp I thinkso I mean to agree I would agree look atthisone four five section six that\\'s likethe Kelly wave yeah you know it\\'s like Khunt with his weight he really got usall broken on now how we measure backdoor so take that K hunt wave out ofyour brain right the one from gums allthe way across to rock pile and look athow amazing that wave is I I agree Ithink that\\'s probably the best bestBarrel so far look at thisthing oh GoPro angle\\'s going to be sickand you know you gotthe with the spit all the thedrama and then this is my favorite claimso far was the hands behind the backinto the close out yeah he\\'s like I\\'mjust going for another one look at thecrew everyone stands out what\\'s goingHolly what mate what oh man look atHolly H is right up oh hands on was thatwas that a Mikey February that clippedin yeah there he is Mikey as wellgetting fired up a that\\'s what we camefor you know that makes you want to sayoh I was going to saydon\\'t forget aboutEmi well we said so at the verybeginning oh yeah no he\\'s he\\'s a threatin allconditions I mean and he\\'s he\\'s comingin with the Swagger just requalified forthe championshiptour yeahthat\\'s people are getting fired upnow and yeah you know he caught two ofthe best waves in the event last yearbothlefts so now he\\'s like oh I got tobalance itout yeah it\\'s uh there\\'s going to besome upsets today oh for sure or what\\'sthe opposite of upsetssome oppositeDowns down downLS on the VIP headset someone who has tobe fired up right now young Emo CAC howare you you sir Yana Yana I\\'m good wavesarefiring how does this wave compare toyour homeBreak um it\\'s different because there\\'salso a right and it\\'s uhmore I don\\'t know it\\'s more kind of allover the place but it\\'s less gnarly Ifeel like but it\\'s such a sick wave it\\'sone of my favorite wave in theworld you know we talk a lot about uhthis this connection of relationshipbetweentoo and and and the NorthShore what whatis it about these two places andcommunities that make it have this likefamily connection uh it\\'s crazy when I\\'mhere I feel like I\\'m home um it\\'s likeeveryone is so cool like home and and Idon\\'t know how to explain it\\'s justeveryone is respectful and and the waysare so good and it\\'s really powerful tookind of like home too so it\\'s definitelygreat to be heresuper stoked to be in this event andwaves are firing right now so couldn\\'task for more Mason ho calls you thesubmarine because you don\\'t see whereyou are in the lineup but you\\'re alwaysgetting under the sickwaves what\\'s your what\\'s your Techniquehow do you lay low but still get surfI\\'m always kind of sitting undereveryone and kind of looking for thebest wave um I like to to move a lotwhen I\\'m surfing and yeah that\\'s it\\'spretty much my strategy moving a lotaround and finding the good waves staybusy and brother how are things at homewith the reef uh and the developmentthere how do you feel about that do youhave do you want to share some someideas about that um it breaks my heartto see all of that it\\'s there I don\\'tknow if you guys saw the live of Cindyuh a week ago but they were breaking thereef by just petting the boat over thereand they haven\\'t even start to put thetower so that definitely breaks my heartand all the construction and stuff it\\'sreally hard for us but hopefullyeverything works out perfectly and andthere\\'s not not too much damage becauseit\\'s already starts to be a lot sohopefully there\\'s no more damage and andwe can save the hoop yeah that is ourour absolute hope it is the mostimportant thing you you have been uh ina very interesting situation in yourHeats here at the at the pipe Mastersand that you you got not one not two butthreeflorenes uh H how have they beentreating you in the Heats are theyboxing you the out like what\\'s going onit\\'s so cool because we\\'re all friendsand we all laugh at the on the line upand stuff but it\\'s definitely reallyhard to get good waves because there\\'sno priority so so and I kind of see themas as my favorite Surfers so it\\'s kindof hard to put myself into like I\\'mgoing to go but I definitely need to dothat on my next hit and I definitelyneed to show that I can get big scorestoo because I haven\\'t really showednothing yet so I really hopefully nextit is the one your style has beencompared to John John\\'s style backsidetube riding is that something that youyou studied or are you aware of thisJohn is always has been my biggestinspiration in surfing and uh it\\'spretty crazy to be against him I meanwith him in a heatand even like to see him surfing it\\'scrazy and his style is what I havelooked up to when I was younger so if ifyou guys think that I kind oflook it\\'s a goodthing well listen we\\'ll let you go uhand and get prepared it\\'s going to be aa heavy heat especially since Nathanjust got knocked out of the top fourhe\\'s down in the fifth place so yeahit\\'s definitely going to be an hard hitlet\\'s see what take char happen yeahgood luck brother okay thank you have agreat dayMaru yeah it\\'s so great to see the thetahan contingent come up hereum reallybelieving in protecting their home butalso wanting to Showcase alongside thepeople here well look at this IM KalaniDevol wow just shooting who\\'s this kaischarging who let\\'sgo oh finish it bro finish itmore wowokay what was he is STO oh Quinny let\\'sgo Quinny drive it oh wowow everyone\\'sholding their breath it\\'s like droppingin what\\'s going todo all right so I guess I got a littletoo emum when we were talking about what thepotential score was for Emi because hegot a25.9 as I was being like 28 29 what didImiss I I don\\'t maybe there wasn\\'t asmuch spit in the wave maybe it\\'s adifficult view from the judgingTower light them up internet what\\'s yourheavy oh well that\\'s why we\\'re notjudges yeah exactly we are emotionalyeah and I guess the judges are not intheir emotions like us will beinterested to see what this is incompared to Billyright now we\\'re going to know okay maybeit\\'s that was a great wave he must beyou know he he came in just to be a partof it throwing praise His Stoke and toget a wave like this oh he must be sopumped he said he had he brought whatseven eight boards in his car justbecause he knew conditions would bechanging looks like he went with alittle bit morelength we do a big shout out to Sho ohand look at Quinny just oh that wouldhave been so nuts oh he almost kind ofmade it looked like he just tripped upat the end almostthere kind of did a a wiggle pump itfalls right there yeah he was on thatbig Cadillac for areasonamazing wow Stakes are high great visionright there the foam ball just caughthim at the end look at him just at theend man good effort though think mighthave been an equipment an equipmentadjustment to probably thinking about itoh what did I what was thatdo that one\\'s going to give him it beinghis dreams forsure isthatu littlequad quad action maybe the the judgesare keeping the scores low because itcould potentially be getting better Imean I don\\'t know man backwards I I Ididn\\'t think that that that wave was a25 me neither but whatever moving onkeep your head up you got to keep itgoing and even if the women had highscores in their heat like judgeaccording to eachheat yeah yeah right just like we didthe last two days right the the the Idon\\'t know again I\\'m not a judge I\\'mjust an emotional surf fan who happensto have a microphone attached to hishead that\\'sall that\\'s all that\\'s the level of myskill set in this conversation so I willball back 5 minutes and 23 seconds to goWilliam keer still has rooms got sittingon two scores uh above 20 you know he\\'dlike to take that14.20 and send it upwards Emi alsoplenty ofroom first heat of the men\\'s and alreadya shift in the leaderboard top two yeahwe knew it was going to be it\\'s going tobe like Sun Sunday at atAugusta yeah this is thisis now every are starting to look at Ithink they\\'re really started thinkingabout their equipment it\\'s going to seebe interesting if Mason\\'s going to doanother fake out tell us he\\'s riding the92 and ride the 49 oh you know he\\'sstressing right now trying to figure outwhat he\\'s going toride billy lay drop first wave of theheat showing everyone it\\'s pipeline timeI mean that was all the things rightcritical drop incredible line Choicedrivingthrough out of I won\\'t even call that adoggy door that was a garage door \\'swave here it is again pumping runningthrough thesections yeah allright \\'s wave yeah we see you judges weseeyou they\\'re just leaving theroom Great Wave great job what did heget on thatthing 19 I think19 this would have been a huge one thatwould have been a huge score if Quinnycould have flowed through that foam balland snuck out I\\'m sure chrisop funk gotan insane shot of that looking into theeyeball oh forsurethree minutes togo no one\\'s safe as you describedeveryone that\\'s coming for this firstheat and you know I I know Billy he\\'sjust like I need one just one more letme get rid of this 14 yeah yeah I meanEmi is in the fourth he\\'s probablylooking for somethingtwo just a better backup you know thethese guys arehungry and look none of the total scoresright now are even at the 60 point rangeas as conditions change the possibilityof somebody walking out with three 320sit\\'s not that hardtotally going out JoyJohnson the working mans people\\'schamp definitely going to be lookingback doorto thread someneedles but then again you look at Mayif if they\\'re looking at judging scoresis the judging or the score potentialeven there if there if the back door isnot getting rewarded as much as mylike questions questions questions andyou know this top 10 herecurrently they\\'re definitely gettingpumped yeah everybody from 5 to 10 couldjust has the potential to go full fullyflared and then there\\'s there\\'s peoplethat aren\\'t in the top 10 that are justsitting on one scores now the the onescores have all been erased now we\\'relooking in double score right world sothere\\'s the single score people like howBilly was that was way down uh in therankings you know Matas MAA Jam o HarryBryant Amo kaana berky yeah umthey they could all could all could allmake ithappen we see some lines out the backwith just a minute togo will they get here in time to shufflethings up evenfurther seee some movement in the lineupas theyare seeing it aswell looks like Billy\\'s going to optBilly going for one more just to put anail in thatcoffin pocket ride but probably notgoing to make a difference in his scoreline yeah but he probably did the mathrelative to how much time wasleft hold the door oh just sending ittrying toget20 secondsleft see the new heat 10 seconds secondsto go I would just send it even if thething Rings whatever it\\'s your last[Music]chanceoh that will be thatso Billy and Emi have done all they cando if you\\'re Emi you are especiallystressed in that fourth spot the chancesof that holding prettyslim asthe this well only continues to build ohthat would not be fun to duck dive atallno so you know um Mikey and Emiwell Mikey still has a chance Emi that\\'sthis is his last chance he\\'s hopingfor he\\'s hoping for it to go flat yeahif you\\'re Mikey and you s that back doorwave of IM you\\'re just you\\'re skippingyou\\'re like when when when when can itbe my turn um we talk about the $100,000and but the The Prestige of being ableto to say that you are a pip Master lookat how Exquisite these trophies havebeen designed I meanoh cast bronze by uh an incrediblenative Hawaiian thinker philosopherartist Solomon Enos we have therepresentation here of namaka okah uhone a massive battle between this oceangoddess and her sister the fire goddessPelle and you can see here in thisperpetual motion of energy there existsthe ability to create and Destroy comingfrom within a big Mahalo to Solomon foryour contribution to this and providingthese contestants of such an amazingpiece of history and how art howwonderful yeah to have that thatbeautiful power of the cultureintegrated into this trophy MahaloSolomon good luck to the competitors aswe\\'re moving into heat two of roundthree oh and here we go round three Heat2 leaderboard shshifting Calla Kenny makukyman now they\\'re there these are thepeople you want to be talking aboutthese conditions two Surfers who arevery familiar with the inside of heavingPipeline and back door they more thanknow more than know theyknowoh what do we have here a leaderboardchange we are uh men\\'s round three heattwo in thewater MikeyWrightRTOruo in Black Joey Johnson in red and andLuke Eddie IO champ shepardson is inthird I\\'m many in fourth in his heatright now with only an 8.30 in his scoreline allSurfers Mikey Wright may have a chancewith his 20po high score but he needs toreplace those two low scores forsure anduh well I mean there\\'s 30 Point ridesthat could have happen so I meantechnically you could be in last placeand get three perfect scores and beshoot right up into contention oh yeahand you could also win this round be atop of the leaderboard first place andstill get fourth in the final so justbecause you won the preliminary roundsmeans absolutely nothing it gets Reedeverybody gets slate Clean Slate back tozero go back to your traditional stylesingle elimination for thefinals and thatwill be uh going down this afternoondecide the PIP master champion thisyeah what an excitingday beautiful surf on top waves arepumping y it\\'s 4to8 at least it went up from earlier was0to8 that last set was probably one ofthe biggest ones I\\'ve seen it was one ofthe bigger ones it was more North wehave a on the inside is that Luke thatis Luke shepardson that wave just gotway too small for anexit Luke\\'s going to be wanting to lookfor a much bigger wave I mean look howpristine that water is and what do youthink causes that that small exit whatdo you think causes the wave to thebarrel to shrink and shrink and Shrinktowards the end this is the direction ofthe wave if it\\'s a double up or not ifit\\'s a little North Insider like thisit\\'s uh beautiful positioning he wasright therewe\\'ll see from the side how close he wasone pump right there one more pumpcoming up yep there it is and look likehe just got caught up on that fo ball hejust couldn\\'t ride over that foam balllike I said if there\\'s more room for himto move in that Barrel definitely wouldhave had a better chance of exiting thebarrel so what do you think is the besttrick for getting over that foam ballthe best trick yeah a pump wouldprobably be the best uh or just like geta little bit higher cuz the foam ball isgenerally try you know when you hit thefoam ball you try and usually stay aslight on your feet as possible you don\\'treally want to push too hard becauseyour board washes out from under you isthat cuz you push and then the fins digdeeper into that foam ball and it couldjust yeah well the foam is is air so itstarts to cavitate the fins it starts toair rate the face of the wave it\\'s notsmooth anymore right so there\\'s there\\'sair under there so your board\\'s going tomove it\\'s not going to be stuck to cleanwater at the face so when you hit thatit\\'s very turb Brant and um you know toget through that you have to have eithera longer board or a lot of speed you gofrom riding a little pony to uh being ona bucking ball oh yeah with your handsstuck in the strap not being able to getout well I think wehave man who got himself into fourthplace in that heat my brother eay colanidevault with Holly down on the beach heman so what do you think easier to thehighest single wave score and uh yousitting in Forth how safe do you feelheading into the rest of the day I I\\'mreally happy of course to to just get areally good wave and uh I was lookingfor the right the last like three roundsso uh finally came to me and I was justso excited to be pumping through a waveand yeah I\\'m in fourth so and beingfirst heat like now it\\'s just a waitinggame all day a bit stressful cuz it wasthe same thing that happened to me lastyear I moved up and then had to watchand move down so hopefully hopefully Ican stay there but longDaye and uh if anyone\\'s going to take aspot throughout the rest of the day whodo you think it\\'s going to be and I Idon\\'t even know I\\'m not even sure who\\'sahead of me um but yeah there\\'s so manygood waves I think it\\'s going to be acrazy day so it could easily you knowguys can get some crazy ones so we\\'llsee uh I got a bag of cash foryou what are you going to spend this oneon the B Vault um man pay my filmermiles over here soyeah this is this is yours Mouse Stubeautiful a thank you so much have agood rest of your day thank you Hollythank you Emi um all smiles it reallydoesn\\'t look like people need much tochange that whole entire leaderboardright there I mean one pumping heat canreally shake up one pumping heat andit\\'s a wrap for a lot of these guys alot of these guys have 20 point scoreline so if they get two waves I mean inmy opinion that Emi back door wave wasunderscored compared to what we\\'ve beenseeing he was deep he was super deeptraveled for a long time anduh I\\'ve seen a score comingearlier that I\\'m notsure how they\\'re scoring the right andthe left but I\\'ll tell you what he mightcolani nonetheless got into the top fourwith that wave and he got all absolutehammersfrom 5ifth to 10th just biting at hisheels biting at Billy\\'s heels I meaneverybody\\'s got a 21 a 20 a 24 a 23 19sI mean it really is anybody\\'s game rightnow between first and 9th I would sayit\\'s probably going to be the biggestshake up unless somebody comes in andjust catch two absolute screamers intheir heat which is totally possible ona day liketoday yeah definitely I mean you seethere like even in the women\\'s side alot a lot of those scores right therewouldn\\'t even have made it into the topfour yeah now the women\\'s got a lothigher scores in their score lines anduh definitely throwing away how how dothe judges judge between men and womenKK what\\'s the difference like how how dothey get higher scores on not as good awaves I would say and then the men getsome screamers and get lower scores whatwhat is the scale do you do you knowwhat what the deal with that is uh Idon\\'t really know what the scale is youthat you\\'d have to ask the the judge isabout thatyeah I just see that uh it\\'s definitelyjudged differently yeah you could tellsamewave same competition differentscoring curriculum from men towomen and uh right now with 18 minutesleft on the clock these guys better putit intogear if they are wanting to get into thetop fourfour you see on your screen Mikey rightinblueruo in Black Luke shepardson in whiteJoey Johnson in red with very veryminimal scores pretty much all acrossthe board until you get to MikeyWright\\'s 20 point score which was abeautifulright first day and we\\'ll see what theycan bring herelittle lull inaction swell is on the risethough so we are going to see some bombsthisafternoon we will see some bombs thisafternoon I hope it\\'s looking kind ofslow it\\'s it\\'s definitely uh slowlycoming up it did a little youknow little paulse for a second thereyou go there\\'s your beach scene downhere at Pipeline on the NorthShore ofwho you are watching the van pipeMasters 2023 don\\'t go anyway we willreturn shortly see yousoon I was 23 at the time I needed asolid job something that I could providefor the family there\\'s a lifeguard trialand that was the first thing I did WEAis super special because it\\'s theoriginal big wave surfing spot I wasable to get to use a few hours of my ownleave that I\\'ve accumulated to to Surfmy heat so I was really in work mode andthen when it was my turn for my heat itwas kind of just like a break fromworking and I was like okay I\\'ll just gocatch a few waves it was as beautiful asbig my Maygets Luke was awinner Luke sheeper the champion[Applause]any welcome back hello every everyonefrom the Bonsai pipeline here on thebeautiful Northshore of Oahu in hav wehave a special guest in studio with usright now one of my closest mates MrTommy low what\\'s up G how\\'s it goingyeah it\\'s going it\\'s going real goodawesome so for you those of you whodon\\'t know Tommy L is no stranger toabsolutely charging if there is a fewnames that come to mind mind when youthink charging big slabs around theworld especially in his hometown tell usa little bit about how you got startedand how all the way across the worldtranslates all over here to places likePipeline and Jaws that\\'s a big questionif you think about it you are part ofthat Journey as well because I came herewhen like I guess 20s and stuff and youand Nate Fletcher like K Alexander camayK all the ogs were just holding it downsince day oneand you basically kind of like took meout the Phantoms like Nate kind of likeChuck me a big wave gun I didn\\'t knowwhat I was doing do you know what I meanwe\\'re I\\'m from England there\\'s no bigwaves there obviously I\\'d been over inIreland but it was a shock put it thatway I\\'m paling out there like this wateris a bit different you know like youkind of showing me how to like put a Leastring on correctly Etc so I was a fullcook did you sell them did you sell themon any any bad ones no we wouldn\\'t dothat to our friends like that especiallythere because you sell someone on a badone out there it could be their last badone that\\'s true and um I mean Tommy justcame back from a big injury in Tahitiwhere you know like we were sayingearlier you don\\'t want to just jump overthe fall sometimes at certain spots oncertain waves because there\\'sconsequences to be paid for not ridingit out or charging it all the waythrough yeah yeah we we want to makewaves don\\'t we that\\'s the that\\'s thegame plan um and over the years I\\'velearned the hard way to be patient andpick my ways pick pick my battles pickmy swells but I\\'m still learning andgrowing and yeah I definitely nearlydied and came back oh we got some actionout the back this could be a perfect 10if he makes it wow please come out yesoh oh God it just CL you got to give himpoints just for that I mean just to makeit to where he made it right there 30Point ride in the making I I say if hedoesn\\'t get 20 points just for that ridemake or not I mean oh man that wasincredible that was literally theheaviest drop I\\'ve seen like so far youand you know a trip is you\\'re going toget see guys get way higher scores he\\'sgoing to get a minute score for that androl out the gnarliest part of the wavedid everything he could fortunately itcloses out I mean watch this justabsolutely charging gets hung up look atthose pumps one twoo I mean you can\\'tget any deeper than that at pipelineperiod riaru riaru is literally one ofthe Gest guys though he\\'s sending itevery year I mean he took off under thelip I mean look at this look on the foball look you can\\'t get any deeper likeI said he was we were just talking aboutriding the fo ball he executed thatperfectly he was making it too like hewas making it just that wave went itjust clamped it clamped him at the end Imean wow look at that you see the yousee that section just close out rightthere I mean there was there has notbeen a bar that good period this wholeevent that was the best Barrel R if Iwent out there this morning and therewas no contest got that I\\'m stoked I\\'mgoing home babe I sent it on one I gotone wav my win you know what I mean soexactly good on him good on him I meanthat\\'s got to be in my opinion the bestBarrel riding so far um I didn\\'t say thebest Barrel made obviously he\\'s notgoing to get rewarded as a make you gothrough all of that and you get a 3.5 a4.5 a4.7 look at that broken boy is that thegnarliest 4.7 or 3.5 you ever seen Idon\\'t know some I think we\\'ve been inJaws together in a heat and there\\'s someweird stuff going on you know that bigwave stuff again you you know you sendit you packit but you know you know what I\\'ve seenover the years honestly I\\'m going to bestraight up with it judges judge onnames as well because I\\'ve seen guys getjust as good of waves if not better witha different name and you didn\\'t get thescore I\\'ll say it I don\\'t careyou can brother the judges do givescores for names and I\\'ve seen itforever it\\'s a good marketing thing andjust just just what how it is I guessbut right here let\\'s look at that againwow take no credit from this man righthere he justabsolutely God do you think if he wouldhave like straightened out right thereand tried to doggy door there\\'s nothinghe could have done about what he didlook right there though right therethough he need extra needed anothercouple I mean he probably would have gotlipped in the head but the safest thatshot\\'s going to be insane from the waterjust that vision is insane to pumpthrough that and ride through that it\\'salmost like Aladdin on his magic carpetjust you know he\\'s running away from allthe guys look at look at all thespectators going everyone\\'s La it\\'s likewhen he trying to come out of the Caveof Wonders and the cave closes down onhim and the lamp goes flying on he staysin as uh here we go Mikey right this guyrips yeah I love watching this guy sirone my favorites seamless look at thatno grab comingout style Mikey is an animal yes he cameover to Ireland actually a few times andyeah I seen some footage talk to usabout that Ireland wave how does itcompare to pipe and jaws and stuff likethat that big left I mean it\\'s hard tocompare right they\\'re all their ownbeasts but there\\'s some similarities Iguess between like Fiji when it doesoutter Reef okay I\\'d say except it\\'smaybe easier to position at mmore soyeah it\\'s a bit easier as far as likeit\\'s more of a slab than a giant sort ofout Reef VI but you know when you\\'re outat Fiji when it\\'s massive it\\'s hard toit\\'s like Jaws you you\\'re looking aroundand you\\'re like whoa this is some bigocean where am I going to get caughtinside next yeah exactly all right youguys I I want your I want your input onthis what do you think looking back atum Mikey\\'s wave and talking about nograbs grabs backside what do you thinkisharder no grab no grab but you know yeahI mean if you you take off and do nograb like Kelly Slater style but you seethe difference is it was no grab to agrab because a lot of the times the nograb is for the big pump in thebeginning control yourself in the barrelwith the grab and a lot of the timespeople like oh he did it no grab we\\'reactually grabbing in the barrel comingout no grab you know what I mean so it\\'sit\\'s it I just think no all the way ifyou go no no no grab then really talkingESP no grab all the way late it\\'s lateand sometimes it\\'s easier but becausesometimes when you\\'re super late and youhaven\\'t committed to the grab you haveto no go no grab because once you leanforward your nose curls I\\'m very good atthat if you\\'re not on that back foot andgetting under the lip you\\'re probablygoing to Pearl really hard but here\\'sLuke sheperson and he\\'s showing you onceagain that pump whoa W wo wo wo buddythere you go barel man there\\'s a no grabthere\\'s a no grab I kind of stalled himkind of perfect that little Bobble atthe beginninghow about Mason\\'s ho like grab to fronthand grab like switch hand grab yeahdragging that back leg off the back ofthe let\\'s go Joey oh oh so close it\\'sright there come on that end section isreally I want to see one of these boysjump the foam ball cuz all the otherscores have been like perfectly riddenlike kind of in the pocket these guysare getting sevens and eights for Iwonder what they\\'re going to grab giveonce you see the guy come jumping overthe foone ball like these guys beendoing this last year I thought Billy\\'sLast Ride was pretty sick and late butlike you say he rode it perfect but itmaybe wasn\\'t the right wave to do thefoone ball grab yeah boy you he wasright where he needed to be on that wayexct I think if it would have beendeeper it would have been hard to doggydoor and you see how the guys aregetting pinched yeah so that\\'s what I\\'msaying maybe the wave\\'s not cooperatingyet maybe is that what you meanpositioning is is key but if you do getdeep and over that foam ball and thenyou come out the doggy door that\\'s gotto be on a difficulty scale level it\\'sgot to be way up there you know so itwould be pretty cool to see the guyscome through hit those foam balls jumpover them and actually exit the barreland we yet to see our first perfect10-point ride it\\'s coming it\\'s comingit\\'s pumping it\\'s filling in swellsfilling in it\\'s only going to get betteryou know now Mak when you take off onthose waves um like the one we sawbefore that incredible ride can you seeall the way down the line at the end ofthe barrel whether it\\'s going to clampor not oh yeah you can pretty much see Imean when you\\'re coming see you\\'relooking down the line to see what\\'sahead of you so when you\\'re lookingyou\\'re kind of seeing this section overhere come at you so you kind of knowokay I got a little bit of time I got togo high you want to try and go a littlebit high to low so you get that speedcoming out and sometimes it\\'s just kindof you got to get out like I said yeahlook at him he was he was on the phoneball yep it seems like that sandbar thatpushed in with that n swell is giving itthat little runoff at the end and if itwas deeper it was a big West swellbefore this and then this swell camethere would be no sand there and thatwave would hold all the way through itwouldn\\'t do that that clamp at gumsclamp yes well hopefully that\\'ll be in acouple of weeks when everyone bailswe\\'re out there brother I\\'ll see youthere oh yes we will be there there\\'sgoing to be more not even a couple ofweeks maybe in a few days after tomorrowit\\'s over yeah like christas Christmasis looking interesting to is our lastday we got now into the back doorshootout right yeah Eddie what else wegot comingEddie we got a lots contest we got a lotof SW wellc coming hopefully I meanthey\\'re talking El Nino this and thatbut it\\'s Midway through December haven\\'tseen a look kind of L to me well nowthey\\'re saying late you know she\\'scoming late yeah yeah yeah they say alot of things that\\'s what happensnowadays too much talking even in herehere comes some uh action yeah here wego yeah give us action once upon a timewe woke up when we said how\\'s the wavesgoing to be I\\'ll tell you tomorrow callyou in the morning old school yeah wellat least we had that era at least we allhad that era I\\'m thankful for thatsometimes forecasting can get trickybecause you know it\\'s a really educatedguest it\\'s not guaranteed yeah and uhsometimes you know I feel like theythrow guys off too oh there\\'s a swellover here too and then that one wasn\\'tthat good but some reason over here ispumpy no one heard aboutit yeah we got surprised that last weekwell didn\\'t we like two weeks ago I justlanded and it was supposed to be likemediumsized I woke up in the morning togo and check the waves and there waslike no Road it was just sand and waterand I was like okay like all right it\\'sone of them is it EXA we got a paddlerighthere who is this is that Luke Mikeyright oh pumping down the lineoohnice little oldbarrels oh is he going for a doublebonus oh not there that that end sectionis unforgiving that is thegobler it\\'s like pipeline\\'s version ofhaliva toilet bow section right goodcall yeah I mean looks like the toiletboy at haliva just sand and that\\'swhat\\'s kind of you see at halivasometimes there\\'s these big ones theycome together and like Oh and it justkind of mushes out kind of what it\\'sdoing right now here at pipeline it hasuh Mikey right only means a 14.4 to getin that top fourspot I mean 14.4 that isnot that much and right here this couldactually be a 14.4 I mean that\\'s onlywhat less than five across the boardyeah 15 would be fives so Imean yeah I think very possible he gotthe score on thatwave we will have to see oh niceone he\\'s just cruising isn\\'t he socomfortable oh yeah look at this guy nohand pump I like that no hand pump rightthere oh that that gives you a lot moremotion that gives you a lot more rangeof motion to pump your board when you\\'regrabbing you only can grab so much whenthe wave\\'s bigger you can do a betterpump with the grab but smaller waveslike this you see how he came off thebottom what\\'s going to grab let go andreally use that Rail and his arms todrive get that line and once he set hisline you see that little chandeliercoming held on for a second right herelook really almost grab and no grab atthe same time pump holds on right therejust to make sure he comes through theturbulence and the perfect way toexecute that ride by Mikey right not alot of people know that uh you know whatthe no grab is for it\\'s actually toposition yourself it\\'s actually so thatyou can move around and pump cuz onceyou grab the rail you\\'re kind of lockedin in the rail it\\'s kind of hard untilit Mellows out towards the end and thereyou go 15 points Mikey Right Moves toFourth and eay Kanani is now out of thetop four wow and that last ride from emowas insane I was so pumped for him buthe just need to get one more that\\'s howit goes he needed to get one more ohmaybe he\\'s not out Mikey Wright still inninth we got to get the true facts inhere before we starttalking Maka with the blah blah blahblah blah blah blah blah sorry guys Ithought I was K Dracula right there inuhTransylvaniawhat no you know and his what\\'s hisdaughter say blah blah blah blah blahblah BLblah no there it is Mike is infourth I was right he is infourth technical difficulties on thebackside waiting for this graphic toupdate and uh today\\'s schedule as yousee will follow to maximize the bestconditions we will reduce heat times to28 minutes so 2 minutes less thanprevious Heats finals to 40 minutesinstead of an hour so 20 minutes off thefinal run of show women\\'s Heats 1through five which we finished we\\'re inmen\\'s heat to now next will be thewomen\\'s finalswomen\\'s pipe Mastercrowning men\\'s Heats 3 through 10 men\\'sfinal and then the award GE willfollow so once again tomyo if you don\\'tknow the name now you do one of theabsolute crackers when it comes to BigWave someone that does not know the wordpull or back do not exist in hiscategory in his vocabulary we love youso much thank you for joiningus for all the years of being wavesurfing together we appr you for all theAloha over the years brother and lovetomm yeah we appreciatewe have a little bit of motion in theocean anduh5 25 seconds on the clock which meansthis wave and possibly the next one andthat is awrap 15seconds we will have a wave approach usprobably with about 5 Seconds to golet\\'s see if somebody can scratch intothis one three but it\\'s just a junk waveyeah no yeah there it is and that is allshe wrote ladies and gentlemen MikeyWright coming inclutch andstealing that fourth spot supposedly ithasn\\'t updated yet souh we\\'re waiting on that but MikeyWright isnow in fourth there we go it has hasbeen updated Billy keer leading the packJohn John Florence in second MikeyFebruary in third and Mikey Wright hasjust squeak into that fourthspot we have a lot of Surfing sevenHeats of mens to go so this leaderboardI am guessing I\\'m going to go out on thelimb and say it will not be the same asit looks now after this women\\'s finalwe\\'ll get back into men\\'s competitionsHeats three through10but right now in the water we do havethefinals CarissaMoore fromHawaii I think that should say Molly puminstead of Molly Molly Good Golly MissMolly though goly Miss Molly pick themshe is picking them pick know how pickthem she was picking off AaronBrooks is in this heat as well and MoanaJones wall your current Queen ofpipeline is out there defending hertitle against one namali pum who wouldlove to just take that off of her handsand hang it on her wall you see she isnot giving her too much space out theresitting right on the inside cornerreally a smart tactic uh sitting kind ofpositioning behind Moana like thatbecause you can let Moana commit andbecause there\\'s no priority whip aroundbehind her if it\\'s a good one andactually take the wave off of heras you can see Carissa Mo opting for themore inside position looks like shewants to hunt those rightand barrels atback door that we\\'ve been seeing we\\'veseen uh IM colanidevault get an absolute cracker and AronBrooks is going tobe look it to me like could be thefirst 16-year-old Pipeline Masterschampion for thewomen maybe the Young pipe Master evershould she take out this heatyeah yeah there\\'s there\\'s a there was afew16-year-olds in this event on thewomen\\'s side 16-year-old who won a pipeMasters no no I\\'m but I\\'m saying in thisevent oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeahthere\\'s been a few 16year olds butthere\\'s only one in the finals that\\'sright there\\'s only one that\\'s got achance right now to become history a16-year-old pipe Masters and uh we willsee Moana Jones wrong is not giving upat all she is going to battle it out tothe very end Mollypicklum can\\'t say enough about thisyoung woman\\'s performance out here wasabsolutely on a tear and I mean KarissaMoore is the queen ofAloha Olympic gold medalist multi-timefive-time world champion right anduh you know right now that man rightthere is looking to represent hav onemore time as she always has done sograciously so ferociously in the waterbut on the land she is the most graciousmost Aloha sweetest person you couldever meet and uh we love Carissa so muchthank you for representing AI from eachand every one of us here in hav we thankyou sister for spreading that Aloha forus around theworld um oh there looks like there ispriority in the women\\'s finals yeahthat\\'s going to why would they want toruin the contest like that by puttingpriorityoh it\\'s the problem in surfing right nowand this is just my opinion it\\'s weakwhen there\\'spriority well they\\'re definitely goingto have to change their strategies up alittle bit when that priority is inplace that changesthings yep you got to be a little moreselective on our roll we have KarissaMoore looks like she is just going toabsolutely oh that looked like anattempt so I\\'m not sure how that workswith priority but I think she would bein last priority now right she missedthat one that\\'s what I don\\'t like aboutpriority is when I paddle for a wave andmiss it and then you go back of the lineshe\\'s the champ maybe we\\'ll just leaveher priorityalone and then Molly p is not playinggames oh shoot that was an upside downdrop what a Comm she hit her head on thefront of the board ah she\\'s got a helmeton looks like she\\'s uh thank God she gotthat helmet on yeah looked like she\\'sgot her board and she\\'s up and she\\'sgetting back out there one more out theback who is this Mo Jones Wong that\\'sright oh sister could have done deeperon that one nice effort double barrel ohwow what a beautiful takeoff I meanthese girls are just absolutely knifingit they are under the lip yeah wow k ithe level has gotten so much better inthe last couple years now that the womenhave had these opportunities to actuallycompete in the pipe Masters you know forthe first time started three years agoand you\\'ve justwatched the level just blowup yeah um I think we have uh we havestanding by the man himself Mr MikeyWright who got himself into that fourspot down on the beach with Holly Mikeyhow\\'s it going hey Mike uh feel like Ikeep asking this question but uh you\\'vemoved up into fourth how safe you feelon heading into the rest of theday ah I\\'m not really thinking about itto be honest I was just stok to get acouple waves no one out but um but yeahit would have been nice to get a properset and maybe get another 20 on theboard but anyway uh I think it\\'s justgoing to get better all day so I don\\'t Idon\\'t see it happening but anywayfingers crossedn I\\'m not even hoping I just it was justgood to get a few waves it\\'d be sick toget another heat in the final but butyeah that\\'s that\\'s a long day and it\\'sjust going to get better and betterso excited to watch yeah it should begood should be a good day of actionanyway maybe might go see that off thewall did you you reckon you had a chairno all right you have a sick of your daymate than oh listening to Aussies talkto each other have to be one of thegreatest things ever I love myAustralian Ohana they\\'re uh like I saidit\\'s like home away from home for methere and they got to be some of themost essential characters on planetEarth they bring the fire they bring theheat they bring the competition theybring the jokes and they bring the loveas well so thank you Australia each andevery one of you out there supportingyour brother Mikey Wright it\\'s speak acompetition makua let\\'s explain to ourviewers that aren\\'t familiar with thepriority how it gets established how youget it how you lose it I think we shouldlose it alltogether Imean so how you get it how you lose itsupposedly when you paddle for awave you lose priority right off the batso but at the beginning of the heatthere\\'s no priority yeah but if you makea committed effort to the wave you\\'lllose priority right you have to pad whenyou paddle and make a committ effort digwhen you dig that\\'s an eff then it\\'swhoever catches the wave first gets lastpriority yeah and so on and so forth soif you\\'re the last person to Catch theWave you will be in last priority or ifyou were the last person to paddle for awave and miss it you also get booted tothe back of the L yeah see it\\'s I meanit\\'s just so confusing just let thesurfer surf battle it out and it\\'s one Lthing some technical Hogie Boogie yougot to think about yeah priority thepriority stuff always threw me off cuz II would I would get it confused in myhead I\\'d be like wait is it my turn Ikind of paddle for that wave am I backof the line uh did did that girl catch awave am I next yeah especially with fourpeople and and a wave of consequence cuzshould you be dropping in deep on thatthat like a boy from Japan\\'s wave hejust caught and then well you can justdrop it on his head just cuz you gotparty that\\'s actually more dangerousthananything but here we go I meanabsolutely charging that was a gnarlywipeout wow I mean she just took that like achamp too Molly picklo let\\'s go and thenhere we go smooth assilk the queen does the queen doing asshe does and just getting absolutelyslotted on this one I mean look at thatside slip on the drop double hand Drslowingdown making it lookeasy Carissa Moore got in on the actiontoo let\\'son the inside oh Insider technicalthough now look at this Aaron Brookscomeon she was pumping in thatthing wow she was right there look atthat trainer it seems like something\\'sgoing on cuz we got some clapping heregoes Molly pum that\\'s what it is itis of course look at that head

big carving turn yeah that was auh was an all rightwave it was uh she was looking to stalla lot deeper I think on that one whenshe took off it looked like she wantedto pull into that one right off the batit was a little crumbly sh to go aroundit nonetheless got a nice pocket ride atthe end with a nice cut back and lookwho do you[Music]know we have the replay here ofCarissa\\'swave coming around the corner stallingsee that how it kind of shut down for asecond there nice little pocket ride onthat one nice carve and then she hits alittle turbulence right here and she waslike all right looking a build on that17-pointrideum so Molly Molly did a couple trips toTahiti this year to practice herbackside tube riding do you think it\\'spaying off whatever Molly did leading upto this vent everything paid off becauseshe is absolutely absolutely on a tearyeah Iagreed and uh looks like we got somelines I seeMoanamjw P girl Moana let\\'s go get in therecome on come on come on that\\'s the rightthere wowso like I was sayingearlier we\\'re going to get some realscores for these waves cuz these aresome real pipeline barrels that wasinsane and the queen said off with herhead it is my turn to show you

here we go MoanaJones just absolutely getting to asmoker look at that bottom turn pullingit and I mean that was it\\'s the bestwomen\\'s Barrel so far I got to sayyeah on AB driving P absolute bomb lookat the spit she knows she knows rightnext to theboil up and in and that was insanethat\\'s got togo wow look how look that that was oneof the biggest that\\'s 28 29 all dayrightthere so the top two waves are going todetermine the winner in this final sothat is going to be a goodscore that is the score of that is thescore and it\\'ll be 100,000 for firstplace second$75,000 third $5,000 and fourth Miss hewill go home with 25 Grand not bad wowwell looks like uh Moana really wants$100,000 yep it\\'s not going to come easybecause wehave one of the most winning females inhistory in this heat which is CarissaMoore and mly picklum just absolutelychomping at the bit to take one of theseevents out and then you got the futureof the sport Aaron Brooks who she mightnot have got a wave yet but I\\'ll tellyou what she is not going to give upwithout a fight 23 minutes left there\\'sa lot of time for these girls to changethis heater around and the score is infor Moana it\\'s almost perfect score shegot a 29 point3 uhhuh uhhuh there wegohawaian is infirst amazingSurfing by all these ladies just to getto this top four you have to have surfedamazingly yes like regardless of whathappens you made it into the finals intoone of the most the most technicalcomplicated things to do is go throughround after round after round afterround and perform high enough so thatyou could crack into a final seaty really cool for I love the format forthis event I love the format for theshootoutEddie it\\'s all uh it\\'s all relevant it\\'syou can watch the best surfer surf theyto Surf all day in all theconditions you know it\\'s it\\'s I thinkthis is the this is the new way this isthe format that needs to be adopted onon the championship to her I would sayso did you knowthat Moana Karissa and Molly are thethree previous women\\'s pipe Masters areall in this heat right now with a new fawith a new Fresh Face 16-year-old AaronBrooks and that face isn\\'t going to gonowhere either she\\'s going to be a faceto remember for a long time Aaron Brooksprobably one of my favorites by far andum sweetest little thing you know she\\'sjust so dedicated and so respectful andreally takes time out of her day to knowthat it\\'s time to work on her craft evenat a young age or she could be you knowthis or that or you know people are likeoh she\\'s only 16 she\\'s got a lot of timeto grow I think she\\'s just Full SpeedAhead and she knows what she wants andshe\\'s probably going to get ityeahdefinitely so as the oceansubsides here at pipeline giving ourwomen a chance to breathe and to processwhat just went down some of thoseamazing rides coming in first placeMoana Jones Wong second place Molly pumKarissa Moore is in third needs an18.9 and AaronBrooks needs29.9 to get into first and we are goingto bringyou a few replays of of Moana Jones Wongand show you how she got to thisfinals I mean just absolutelythreatening the needle right there onthat[Music]one perfect positioning I mean righthere you can see how comfortable she ison her board yeah she knows what she\\'sdoing I mean she\\'s smiling all the waythrough that Barrel she\\'s alwayssmiling and they\\'re right here justbehind the section pulls up tight onjust a glassy wave I was going to saythat wave was so glassy I mean justbutter look atthat big Grabel Cy oh this was a sickone righthere spitout beautiful linebeautiful coming from behind like thatand just her positioning is just amazingtiming is impeccable and like I saidright here just showing how comfortableshe is took off behind the lib and justpacked thatthing and look at the smile look at thesmile look at that smile 20 minutes togo check thatout I mean supporters on the beach Ithink that is Bella Kenworthy and SierraKerr if I\\'m notmistaken I think they have Molly Pam\\'sboard down there her backup boardgetting it ready for her nice here\\'s afun fact uh Aaron Brooks made the finalin the Pang cup in the men\\'sdivision she even took out uh Nick vonrum in the semis so beating up on theboys that\\'s amazing we should get thegirls and the boys all in one divisionnext year out here see how itgoes that\\' be perfect one contest allone together same conditions samejudgingcriteria and uh yeah I mean I remembergetting beat by Cena sore back in thedays oh Cena was at uh I got beat atpine trees by Cena and I beat by BBartel and uh I beat Andy in his firstconest he never forgave me for that oneI don\\'t think anybody will forget thatday but anyways from The PipelineMasters we are here in the women\\'s finalfrom the beautiful Northshore of Oahuthe most beautiful Coast you have everseen aihotoo thank you brother thankyou the inside of pipeline sounds likethis Fairy like a giant diesel enginejust rumbling and grumbling when I gotthat one big wave when it back spit Icould hear everyone whistling andyelling on the beach and it sucked allthe sound in and that was really loudand crazyand I just hear all the screams and Hotsand hollers and whistles just flying byme it was one of the craziestexperiences welcome back live fromPipeline on the NorthShore of Oahu inHawaii we are here at the Vans 2023PipelineMasters while kiala this final is reallyshaping up to be a cracker of a heat wehave some huge scores by Moana JonesWong and Molly picklum but don\\'t forgetyou need more than one score you will bejudged on two scores and Carissa Mooreonly needs an18.9 yeah Mo to overtake that firstplace she\\'s going to need to have abackup you\\'re not going to do it on Wone wave but man she\\'s she\\'s got herselfin a good position to win at all thoughand too many times over the years we\\'veseen people get too comfortable with a10-point ride and still not even makethe heat wild so I mean it\\'s a it\\'s athingthat it\\'s an unspoken rule that justbecause you did got a 10 does not meananything you definitely need to havesome type of backup score to either getyou into the top spot or get you throughtheserounds and uh it\\'s interesting thepositioning these girls are taking againlooking like Carissa sitting on theinside it\\'s almost like they\\'refollowing Moana but then they don\\'treally want the one Moana wants maybeand then it kind of goes down the linelike that because that\\'s the exact samepositioning they had when they startedthis seat Well if they keep leaving itup toMoana Moana is going to take it well youknow what they say the the ocean choseMoana right in the movie and it\\'s kindof like now that wave\\'s coming and herewe have Moana on the ocean anduhyeah what a story too coming from behindto get in that final you know she shewas on the Hanging On The Edge there andthen having Frankie right there about tolike take your spot that\\'s what I meanhaving the waves actually twice and notbeing able to complete the rides I meanwhen she started today Moana was comingfrom behind hoping to get in that thattop four spot she she got there and thenshe was just she had to wait a coupleHeats just to see what everybody elsewas doing she had a couple girls on herheels and now sheshe could be the pipeMaster definitely she\\'s on her way todoing it too she\\'s got a29.3 right now is Moana Jones Wong inthe water in pull position followedright behind just like you see themlined up in the ocean followed by Mollypigum cover some more and we have AaronBrooks Sitting a little wide and in andwe\\'ll see uh how this positioning righthereit it\\'s it\\'s it\\'s interesting to me tosee every time they line up they kind ofline up in the same you know uhformation formation it\\'s it\\'s Moana BaliCarissa but who has priority right nowbecause even though moana\\'s out the backand the bomb might come she if she\\'s ifshe doesn\\'t have priority she\\'s going tohave to atease that\\'s the problem withpriority just because that guy caught awave really means nothing if you go backinto the right position and you\\'re inposition for the next wave you should beable to get down two I\\'m not sure whatthe priority is right now we don\\'t havea priority indicator here in the uhBooth but uhnonetheless regardless of what happensbig bombs coming through I\\'m pretty sureMoana Jones long is going to put herselfin position and uh yeah there we go cuzwe see Molly picklum paddling towardsthe back door side of your screenscreen I\\'m not sure what she sees herebut uh Aaron Brooks also looking on theinside beautiful wave get in thereoh just kind of hit a hit a little snagthere on the drop and had to it\\'s reallytricky when you get to the bottom therebecause if you push too hard sometimesyou Pearl yeah and then as you seenthere she didn\\'t push really hard andshe was able to get that nose to stay ontop of the water you know and kind ofride out into the flats but it\\'s a verytricky situation because itstarts it starts from when you drop inand the way you position your board andwhere you\\'re angling is how you can getyou know into that position but thereyou see your priority judge up there MrMarty and uh Marty Thomas up there nostranger to competitive surfing andcalling these events here at Pipelineand uhlooks like Chris Amar holding for hispriority rightnow you usually read left to right but Imean maybe they got it right to lefthere I\\'m not sure but I would think bluewould have priority first black and thenred but maybe not maybe it isred I wasn\\'t in the heat[Laughter]briefingbut wow I mean look at how just thespray off of the Waves the texture onthe water I mean the conditions havestayed so nice all day and it\\'s going toget nice and windy andradical towards the end of the day youare going to see some air drops somechandeliers and some very deepbarrels one thing about pipeline is ittends to suck youin you\\'re in the barrel and it likesucks backward and stings your face andthen blows out from behind and you don\\'teven know where you are and hopefullythere\\'s no guillotine doggy doorsections landing on yourneck but oh you see how her board justkind of got weightless there for asecond she couldn\\'t engage the finsright off the drop hereright there the board disconnects itgives a little bounce if her board wouldhave stayed to the face she would havebeen able to get on that front Rail andturn but right here you\\'ll see it moveright there yeah that\\'s the part whereit kind of got sticky and if she wouldhave pushed right there probably wouldhave lost the fins or dug the nose soshe did a great job technically to pullthat out that was not an easy drop byany means especially the night fit underthe barrel I mean that wave was sickyeah that little snag just messed up thetiming where she couldn\\'t get under thatlip and get in that barrel and pipelineit gets real tricky you see when the howthe water is going across your screenacross our Surfers nose of theirsurfboard that means the winds are alittle bit Northeast and that\\'s going tobring a little side chop into the waveso sometimes you\\'re taking off and ifthat you\\'re behind that side chop I sayyou got to bang that little bumper or goover it as you\\'re dropping into a supersteep spot so it makes it a lot moretricky when you have those side chopscoming across the wave there goes AaronBrooks again just absolutelycharging I think my brothers in the nextHeat next going cracker too JamieO\\'Brien Makai mam Eli olon CoRothman leaderboardchange but right now we have 10 minutesleft in thefinals and we will be waiting to see whoor if anyone gets that backup scorecompletes a ride and Imean yeah Molly Pikman her backup waveright now is a 1.3 so she definitelyneeds to get rid of thatone yeah I mean um would do you if youwere in her position right now maybe tryand move inside and just get a higheryou know like a mid-range score just tojust no not at all because I think shehas priority if the if I read thepriority screen right but uh she\\'s inthat top three at least priority there\\'snine minutes left there\\'s absolutely noreason to wastetime when you need a score let\\'s look ather first wave righthere just just charging that\\'s the onewhere she went down so hard that\\'s justwhat happens when you charge hardsometimes you know that\\'s what happensbut there\\'s Moana Jones charging hard aswell that was her first wave silkysmooth just cruising in thatBarrel then we got Carissa Carissa MO ona nice backside smaller insidewave and then right here is the comboNation comingout and then just some Mass massivere-entry off here beautiful you knowwhat they call that right there oh andhere\\'s Moana here\\'s the highest score intheHeat big beautiful Barrel we got a namefor this kind of stuff right here whenyou do this kind of stuff especially ina heat comes out and goes boomKanani there we go that was anincredible incredible wave there is yourheat leader right there Moana Jones justdoing what Moana Jones does her boomKanani moment getting her right backinto the lead where shebelongs Mr mesit\\'s Moana Joneslong and uh 8 minutes left in this final8minutes untileternity it will feel like eternitythese last 8 minutes if you are not inthe lead and it will also feel likeeternity if you are because you want theheat to end and the horn toblow 7 minutes remaining the ocean goescalm and within 7 minutes I\\'m prettysure there is going to be a flurry butup next eight more men\\'s Heats then themen\\'s final and that is a wrap for the2023 Vans pipeMasters I hope you all stick with usthroughout the rest of the day andespecially tune in to that final becausethat is going going to be anabsolutecracker there we go again Mahana JonesWong in first Molly pum in secondCarissa Moore in third and Aaron Brooksin fourth all the surfing that was donethe past few days none of it mattersanymore because right now is the onlything you have been looking for to thiswhole event the finalsand winning and taking home the covetedVans pipe Masters women\\'s title for2023 Molly Pam in second place is sowithin Striking Distance she only needsa small score of an 8.5 to jump in thelead Carissa Moore needing um 18.9 whichwould be easy for Chris amore to pulloff so still anyone\\'s game but that waybyMoana yeah I mean that just like I saidthat was just boom and uh she\\'s uh thequeen of pipeline for areason right now she has three womenright behindher and there is mybrothercorRothman about to get out there with jamyO\\'Brien Eli Olen and Makai mcamera Imean that is a heat the boys will not begiving anybody any waves I guaranteethere\\'s no brother brother camaraderieKumbaya anything going on in that heatespecially when you\\'re going for$100,000 right now and up and ridingMoana taking no time pulling in ohyeah and she is definitely going tobetter her low score andsolidify her lead with just coming up onabout 5 minutes remaining she has got tobe feeling pretty confident right nowwas that one of those bingo bango picklemango kind ofthingshuh waiting for a score shehas definitely better a6.5 there\\'s nodoubtbig remaining and look at thatChandelier on your facethe swell does look like it\\'s turning abitnorth look at these sets coming throughthis is going to be an exciting finishMaka it has been anexciting 35 and a half minutes and rightnow with bombs out the back Molly Pam islooking to pick them herself she\\'slooking to pick one oh yes she is is andif she picks one she has theskill and the goal to be able to make itlike I said the swell is turning Norththat\\'s why you see these wash throughsthis is the swell coming up and as itcomes up this swell is due to be moreNorth so the Heats in the morning mighthave had a lot more Westerly scoringpotential not as much running down thereef and you\\'re going to see these guysthroughout theday the rest of this women seat thatdoggy door is going to be a big factorand either making these waves or notlike we seenearlier with ru\\'s wave still waiting onscores for moana\\'s last wave but thatshould definitely solidify herlead and Mollypum is going to be looking for thatbackupscore B Pam\\'s definitely going to beneeding a score as so as everybodyelse I mean look at that back door in itscoot spitout let say it have to go about the 18ppoint range yeah sixes across the boardright beautiful wave beautifully servedthe positioningjustlook how fast she was going rightthere just very like foot front footvery far forward on the board to getthat speed and she just comes shootingout kicking out into thatbeautiful crystal clearwater commentatorsopinion has Moana Jones had more bigbarrelsthan any woman on earth Kella Kenley doyou think she\\'s got more big brows thanyou I don\\'t think so sorry she mighthave got a lot of brows at pipe but Jawschopes pip I still think K\\'s got themost bigbarrels wow but she oh oh she hadthat that\\'s one of those Kahuna pusspuss kind of things you know littleHogie Boogie on the side fall fall fallher competitors did not want her to makethat wave she 20 points she is having anabsolute commanding lead on she tryingto put a little icing on it with thatlast wave minute and 30seconds let\\'s check the replay deep onthe bo strong paddle barely got underthat lip and then just kind of slid outit looked like it was kind of closingout anywaysMoana Queen Moana watch the lip almosttake her head out rightthere by oh a little Bobble in thebarrel right there that\\'s a feeling thatyou\\'ll never forget is falling andwatching The Wave Barrel as you slidedown on yourback wow I mean most guys can\\'t even dowhat she just did right there mosthumans on planet Earth can\\'t get underthat lip and Moana Jones justabsolutely missed the Gby probably fraction of aninch that was impressive here comesourwomen\\'s champ I\\'m going to

right here it\\'s where I\\'m bornand raised and I never thought I wouldever surf P when I was younger and thenI watched some of my best friends surfout here like M Pang and like B Mia andno B and cl and I wanted to be like themso I started surfing out here and Inever thought I\\'d becomegood you\\'re damn good uh What are yougoing to spend the money on I don\\'t knowI have no idea I didn\\'t even think aboutthat until right now I just was thinkingabout catchingwaves it thank you sogood thank you Holly and uh I don\\'t knowabout you Dr Kono but they\\'re cuttingonions in here yeah you cannot

Wong to say she\\'sborn and raised her and herhusband tahande coming in how exciting were thosewaves that she\\'s got I mean it waspretty much night and day Moana surfingcompared to what else was going on outthere itwas it seemed to be that it was her dayit was her day and also I mean shout outto Molly Pam and Karissa uh and Aaron Imean the manner in which theypushed that moment to happen happenedthat Moana was like okay clearlyeveryone has come to play and that thatmistake that that Molly pcka made withpriority that that last wave that uhMoana got that would would have beenMolly\\'s if she hadn\\'t paddled for thatwave she was still thinking in the oldmindset perhaps of the earlier roundsbefore we went into priority and it costher but like you said itwas really throughout the entire EV youcould feel that Moana had she had thespirit Moana so stoked you know it canit shows how much that this means to her$100,000 what are you going to spend onI don\\'t know I\\'m just I\\'m stoked to getthose waves now think about this whenMoana Jones was was a young girlthere there wasn\\'t a a pipe Master as asa woman to look up to for this nextgeneration of young women to watch herperformance especially local Hawaiiangirls to have that as a as as somethingto look forward to as atotem these are the moments that 10years from now 15 years from now will beable to see the shift that happens fromthis oh on top of it too a native H Kakiperson to to be able to take her placeand like we say time and time again theHaw culture it\\'s a matriarch it\\'s thewomen that lead the charge and it\\'s justcontinues to exemplify with CarissaMoore the new crop of surfers and MoanaJones Wong she\\'s out here uh justdemonstrating exemplifying our cultureand our heritage what a well-deservedwin congratulations Wana it\\'s so amazingto see you win well during the the thechair up of the queen Eli Olsen decidedto step up to the plate Eli he told meright after we got out of here he said Ijust want some waves I wanted to getnutsI\\'m ready I want it full on and thisladies and gentlemen is EliOlen Yeah in our interview earlier thismorning he was trying to contain hisenergy he was so fired up look at thathe\\'s he\\'s stoked he said he\\'s got greatboards he feels great his body\\'s healthyand that\\'s just showing when he\\'spulling into these waves now youknow that thing was a nut strainergetting underneath it look behind thesection you see that look like a backdooring pipeline yeah no and then forfor those who surf out here atpipeline they know sometimes those waveslook like they\\'re breaking as you\\'retaking off and to have this definitelywas breaking down the line um and tohave that knowledge to know this is agood one I\\'m going Eli Olsson isdemonstrating his experience as a localhere in the NorthShore moving from 33rdto 13th the single wave 24.8and as we\\'ve talked about the excitementof the exciting part about this formatis with 19 minutes to go Eli Olssoncould he could get three of those yeahand suddenly this leaderboard can changeso Billy keer John John Florence MikeyFebruary and Mikey Wright in that onethrough four spot cool telling Jamie I\\'mgoing backaway ended up not makingthat choice Eli only needs an 18.9 tomove into the finals if things stay atwhere the artnow well he no doubt he\\'s going to bemade aware of that from the beachannouncers and he will be hunting andfocusing as like he told us earlier he\\'slike I want I want I didn\\'t I didn\\'tcome here just to perform and have agood time I want to be in thisfinal and no doubt H how could he not beinspired by Moana Jones Wang\\'sperformanceyeah he\\'s stoked he\\'s hearing his scoreshe\\'s trying to do the math in his headJamie said yeah you got a good score Igot to I got to do some work don\\'t talktome fourHawaiians in in this heat 3 m mcnamerfrom here on the NorthShore Eli as wellJamie O\\'Brien and corRothman all essentiallyneighbors who are used to sharing thislineup with a whole lot more people on aregular basis Jamie O\\'Brien of coursebeing the Elder Statesman the one who\\'spaved the way for what high performancelooks like at pipeline Jamie lookingsuddenly Eli\\'s leading the heat butstill has to compete against the entirefield of competitors to get to that topfour finalsposition and how about uh contestdirectorand Co Rothman turnsslate driving driving through somechandeliers nice one forcor but Nathan Fletcher rolling the dicemaking the call I I was talking to himearlier he\\'s like there were more than afew people this morning when it wasliterally two feet out here who were inmy in my ear with their feet feelingsletting me know that they didn\\'t want togo today and uh he said sometimes youjust got to bank on the experience andwhat you knowand looking at the charts and he saidwe\\'re going I\\'m going to live on thisdecision and he looks like a like a puregenius greatdecision NathanFletcher Legend in his own right here atpipeline riding himselflong boards to shortboards co co has a real good ability tolate drop you know he just trusts hisrails and he just tippy toes down intowhere he wants to go trusts his line andpulls into these barrels and then kindof just hopes the wave does the rest forhim beautiful job negotiating thosesections I mean you just never stopmarveling at what it takes to complete apipeline wave not just making the dropand then line Choice and then everythingthat has to be NE the decisions thatneed to need to be made in the barrelyeah and being able to move up on thethe front of that board to not sit onthe tail to for that stability to youknow to transition from using your finsto your rail engaging the rail I thinkthat\\'s something that is really uniqueabout a great pipeline Rider is theirability to negotiate from uh put on thethe back foot or the front footespecially in these bigbarrels on the pipe on the pipeline sidewould you rather be uh going going fronthand front side or backside thatpipe this is an interesting one becauseitseems there I\\'m sure you\\'re going to geta mixed bag here I would I would saybackside going left atpipeis more fulfilling in my mind to see uhpound forp pound I think front side itlooks reallybeautiful um technically though I\\'mbiased I\\'m I\\'m natural stand so I reallylike to see backside uh backside barrelsyou know letting go of that that Railand Standing Tall in those thosebeautiful things towatch listen I\\'m goofy footed and Iwould agree that there\\'s the Stak seemto be a lot higher and the techniquenecessary I iip you know you watch JohnJohnKelly um it\\'s it lookscool yeah I it\\'s uh by the way I justgot kicked out of the goofy footedfraternity roking my membership rightnow I just seenuh pcha light she posted something onthe social media about uh Craig Andersonon a bus in Ecuador and he was uhswitched they switched his stand so hewas a regular foot and I was looking atI was like I don\\'t know I don\\'t evenknow if he look he as good if you\\'regoing regular I think just goofy Footershave that natural ability to style out Imean listen don\\'t get me wrong I thinkthat we are superior overall just inlife uh but I am also a fan of of whatregular Footers can do in heavy leftandbarrels oh yeah I mean but still but Ithen but then I look I look at someonelike Gabriel Medina at pipeline who hasthis ability to make it look that muchmore critical in his positioning to youknow what I mean do some really reallyequally nuts things in his approach thatmake it look just as critical well Benjibran you look at Benji he the thingsthat he on his front hand it it looks hehas a style about him that makes it lookextreme and scary uh and and it\\'s stillappealing yeah we we were talking toBenji bran earlier and I was asking himas this swells coming up you know whatare you thinking about and he\\'s like Iwas thinking 64 but now as it continuesto come up he\\'s like I\\'m I\\'m going tohave a 68 on standby just in case hesaid you he said I really don\\'t wantanything bigger than that because hesaid as you saw J quinny\\'s wave like youget in but then you want to have thatability to navigate and negotiategetting up and over those sections he\\'slike so I don\\'t really like anythingbigger than than a6869 so that I can maneuver andcruise speaking of maneuvering andcruising I believe that we\\'re going tohavea a guest on the headset shortlysomeone who\\'s been maneuvering andcruising uh won\\'t tell you who just yetwe have you on standby seems like a stabhole of 7,000 Surfers uh agree and 64%would be drawn to watching someone pullin at pipeline as a natural footer nowwere were was that the was was that likesubscribers or everyone who goes subabthat probably was people who want a freesurfboard wet suit wax or a subscription64% makes sense so regular Footers whatI see 64% of regular foot Surfers wantfreestuff well let\\'s uh check in uh

beenhelping me a lot with the mental side ofthings and just really prepping my mymind for days like this and justtrusting you know like I\\'ve done this myentire life and you know with yeah withthe broken foot I haven\\'t done that butuh just knowing that this is normal forme I\\'m more normal out there than I amhere right here on on land you know Ifeel more comfortable on a wave in thebarrel pipeline than I do walking in thestreets and um that\\'s something thatyears of just you know learning askingquestions getting hurt uh falling youknow it takes so much time and andpatience and I\\'m just happy to be in inthis situation I got my little my kidsright here he\\'s running away from me Lonboy this guy gives me all the courage inthe world he uh he taught me how tofight in life this guy

partner um mywife\\'s here my kids Hayes I\\'m justenjoying it now this is this is a dreamcome true this a pipe Masters that\\'s whymy son skiing school todaywow BR Billy it seems that no prioritycan be difficult for some people and andnot not a big deal for others could youexplain some of that I mean Cliff youknow we grew up here this is the this isthe most powerful place in the worldwhen it comes to surfing there\\'s nothinglike this right here in front of us andthere is never priority out here there\\'srespect there\\'s uh you know there\\'s atotem pole of of respect of growing upand putting in your time and and gettingyour w and just really learning and uh Igrew up under the the greatest of alltimes you know I was standing right herein these yards watching Andy and Brucewin I watched Derek Ho like Johnny BoyKima Henry my brother Eric like Iliterally grew up idolizing some of themost iconic Surfers in the world andthey\\'re all from here and it just camewith a lot of respect and I feel likeI\\'ve I\\'ve earned my stripes out here andI put in my time and when it comes to anevent like this without priority thereis a little sense of um kind of a freesurf Vibe but at the same time it\\'s likeI\\'m not going to sit there and letpeople paddle around me and just takewaves I I I truly want to win like Ithat I I told myself three days beforethis event I went and caught two wavesand I said okay I I physically andmentally believe that I can win thisevent so I\\'m going to compete and thatwas kind of the that was the the switchfor me of I\\'m going to do this event andum that\\'s where my mind\\'s at I know I\\'mgoing Wave by wave and just kind oftaking it easy and being picky but truthtruthfully like I I\\'m in this to win andI\\'ll do anything in the will of my powerto win um whether it\\'s two foot waves or80 foot waves winning is winning to meand there\\'s always a way to do it youjust got to work hard and and visualizeand believe in yourself and I got a lotof belief and a lot of good energy withmy family and friends behind me sohonestly I I I I don\\'t I don\\'t seeanything right now besides pipeline inmyself that said Billy um we\\'ve seenscores going up and up today obviouslyas uh the stakes have gotten higher withthis bigger swell you\\'re sitting on a58.6 right now do you think that will beenough um with these Heats ahead to tohave you in the final when this round isover you know it\\'s hard being in heatone um in this situation because it\\'skind of like a waiting game and you\\'rehonestly leaving it in other Surfershands which uh I personally I\\'m I Idon\\'t like that I want I want to be Iwant to have control I want to have theopportunity but I told myself being inheat one you know knowing that I do havea broken foot this is it like I got to Igot to pull the trigger and I got tomake sure that no opportunity willpresent itself without me conquering andovercoming and uh I feel like I did thatwith every kind of every opportunitythat that showed up in the heat um I didwhat I could I I haven\\'t fallen in thisevent I feel you know pretty damn goodfor where my situation is at and umI\\'m not counting myself in I\\'m notcounting myself out I\\'m just here andI\\'m ready to roll like if if I\\'m in thatfinal I\\'m I\\'m going to show up to winand uh I\\'m trusting the process that uhmy spirits that have left me

Elilooking for an18.9 ding J was needing an 18 so with 20seconds to go there might be one shotyou see Jamie spring inting to the northwhat\\'s he going to do look people arelooking back door pipeline oh Eliscratching scratching trying toget Co went right Eli did he takeoff that\\'s itnza you know that\\'s got to be you knowlike Billy was saying that\\'s a a backdoor shootout heatand for these competitors not to findthe waves that they know they get onany given day out here pipeline I\\'m sureisfrustratingabsolutely that\\'s especially Eli youknow he you saw how fired up he was andthen when you get that big big score atthe start of the he that you fired upbeing like okay let me get more let megetmore but wasn\\'t to be hadcongratulations to all of them though onfineperformances here at this F pipe Mastersas we moveinto heat4 noBashan and Mason hoe Matoshery and the man from South Africa MikeyFebruary whostill after two rounds finds himself inthat topthree and just a his performance at atback door on the first day stillstands I I I think as the new swellstarts to fill in it is projected tostart to swing north um and with theenergy coming in so quickly on a abuilding swell it\\'s it\\'s this isn\\'tpicturesque pipe right now uh but it\\'sit\\'s definitely not bad at all by anymeans but we\\'re looking at theconditions uh we\\'re going to see someHeats that are going to be incredibleand there\\'s going to be some Heats thatI think are going to be a bit lacking inwave opportunity you see here into theHorizon there\\'s not much not much goingon or can\\'t really see too much out onthe horizons which is nice about thiscoastline is there\\'s these outer reefsthat exist that they\\'re kind ofindicator reefs looking to the north youhave these reefs outside of PUK and youyou know straight out you have the thirdreef outside of ehukai and you also havesome other reefs more down towards logsand rock pile that you can kind of startto gauge what\\'s coming what happeningbut when it\\'s underneath the size ofswell that it can actually break onthose autter reefs you\\'re now justwaiting for them to pop up like some ofthe competitors or something well forthose of you uh who have not been withus for the entire three days and youjust tuned in and you\\'re like what\\'sgoing on here leaderboards Etc uh afterthis wave here by NoahBashan grabbing and dancing through thislittle pipe wave is he going to find anair section he\\'s going to have to tobring the score up on this I thinkI don\\'t know if that\\'s going to beenough to get him no that won\\'t be let\\'sbe honest um but it\\'ll but\\'ll get himfeeling good yep and uh into thedirection that he wants to get the scorehe\\'s looking for uh let\\'s give you guysa look little review of what this formatis this unique specialty format here atthe Vans pip[Music]Masters[Music][Music]classdismissed you all know how itgoesas scratching Mikey Mikey February toodeep out there as that thing runs offand we are honored here in this heat 4to welcomein the one and only onlylenover Laura an hello hello guys sogood to be here with you guys we arehonored to have you uh it\\'s not a everyday that we get to hang out withGuinness world record holders but herewe are like Kermit theFrog oh how was that uh how was yourlast Heat coming out and and could youkind of explain to us what that was likeout there on a a rising swell flat tobombs what was that like it was it wasso sick to get out there I mean everytime you surf out pipe I mean I haven\\'thad it happen a lot when you you\\'re outthere alone like I\\'ve I\\'ve done thisevent at pipe and then uh last yearsurfing out here but every time you\\'reout in that lineup and you have it toyourself it\\'s just it is just magicaland scary and you\\'re you just have totrust your trust yourself and know whatyou\\'re doing and like we\\'ve seen todaywhoever\\'s you know knows this lineup thebest is getting these incredible wavesas we see Mason ho having look here butuh it was you know epic me uh Frankiehar and and Coco ho we really close andwe tried to get in the same heat and wewe nailed it and um yeah it was justlike really fun to be out there and justlike call each other into waves and Iwas pretty far down the leaderboard andand when Frankie got her her wave I waskind of like you know wanted to get heranother wave to try to push her up theleader board so we were we were beingnice at their ladies rules andunfortunately e got injured and uh thatwas just it\\'s super scary so all prayersto e she\\'s an incredible young youngSurfer and up and coming charger so justreally hopeing she\\'s going to be okayand update on Eva Wong um she had a headinjury um from going over the fall shewas attended to by our medical staffhere at the beach and after evaluationthey said you know what let\\'s send youoff to hospital to get some furtherevaluation she will be okay um hopefullywe\\'ll be able to update you uh on hercondition but as we said we wish youngewang uh the absolute best and that isthose are the stakes uh at pipeline it\\'sit\\'s all fun and games but as we\\'ve beentalking about What Lies Beneath thesurface here um makes every wave riddenyou got to be you you got to be makingthe best choices that you can oh andjust watching that girls final like I\\'vejust been so inspired by the up andccoming the next gen coming out todayobviously Carissa who\\'s you know alsoQueen in her own right out therecharging but you know Moana eron Sierraand Molly um just incredible watchingwhat they can do and how they can surfout there and and that has come with alot of time spent out surfing pipe andand that\\'s I think what has inspired meI think you know these girls have beensurfing at since they were 14 and itshows they they know the lineup and theyknow what they\\'re doing out there andit\\'s just really cool to watch and uhyeah they\\'re amazing you were a partof a movement with with Koko and yourpeers that really set so much forward inmotion now you look at this nextGeneration especially what\\'s happeningfor high performance what does thismoment mean here at pipe for this nextgeneration of of of young women comingup what does this mean for the sport ofwomen surfing oh it\\'s just justunbelievable these girls yeah justbreaking down barriers and uh yeahmaking us all believe that we can do itand yeah know with the hard work timededication like every morning I sawCarissa out there still going for a freesurf she\\'s been competing for so manyyears and she still is out there everymorning at the Cracker Dawn putting inthe time uh and yeah it\\'s just likeincredible to see that work ethic fromher but uh you know her she\\'s P she\\'spaved the way uh them to see Moana dowhat she\\'s done I think she\\'s inspiredso many and made us believe that yeahlike you can be small and petite and andlike just still send it out pipe it\\'slike really really cool yeah you whenyou actually see Moana in real lifeyou\\'re just like Oh I thought you werelike 7 feet tall totally yeah I mean Iwas like are you she\\'s getting smallerlike she\\'s just she\\'s a little pocketrocket it\\'s amazing and that Mollypicklum is going to be yeah it\\'s it\\'snuts I\\'m so proud of them it\\'s just it\\'sjust thebest 1959 here togo and uh Direction wise as this swellhas continue to build what are we seeingas some of these waves are sort ofpassingby you can kind of even see some ofthese SWS kind of cross cutting as thestrong wind swell is going to also becoming in there\\'s like a Northeast windswell so you\\'re starting to see some ofthese swells kind of dislodged it\\'s nothaving that nice long West break you\\'regetting somedisconnection uh and then you have toalways think about what number set isthere too much water that goes onto thereef is the first one the best is it thesecond one you know sometimes there\\'sfive wave sets we\\'ve seen in a heatwhere is the last one the best or is itjust too bath tubed out what was it likeLaura when you\\'re out there when you youseen how throughout your heat it seemedto change even yeah it\\'s been changingall day you know this is an incomingswell so we knew that they you know we\\'dbe out there and and you know there\\'d bethose double ups that would come youknow the medium ones and then all of asudden we need to be you know just awareof our situation there could be anabsolute bomb coming from uh the boilout there so just trying to be aware andjust be ready for anything really do youremember your first pipeline session andand who who did you surf with I thinkfirst pipeline session I I feel like Iwould have been around 16 or somethingand I just uh you know was out theresort of watching on the side and justlike making my way up and then I kind oflike got a bit intimidated by the crowdand moved over off the wall and spentlike the last like five seasons surfingoff the wall and I think that\\'s like bitme in the ass cuz now I go out pipe andI\\'m like I don\\'t know what I\\'m doinglike where is the wave like and I needto put in the time there I think that\\'swhat I\\'ve I\\'ve realized it\\'s like theonly way you get to know this wave is bybeing out there watching the best of thebest do it where they\\'re going to wherethey\\'re taking off um yeah where they\\'relining up and yeah how they\\'re justabsolutely sending it where doespipeline\\'s power fit in terms of youryour globaluh travels cuz you you\\'ve been to yourGlobal sandfest yeah I mean you\\'ve beento the biggest and the the gnarliestwaves on the planet where does pipelinerank in that for you oh I mean pipelinejust comes with its whole other fear Imean I think the the fact that you knowthis is one of the most dangerous wavesin the world you see the most injuriesgo down here you see the most headknocks every year that I\\'ve been here Ifeel like you\\'re watching someone getinjured and and get sent away in theambulance and it\\'s so scary and it\\'sjust you have to be so brave andcourageous out there and also smart Noahoh yeah and you\\'re seeing people who gethurt it\\'s not just like Cooks yeah soit\\'s the of your mind and you have toactually work out how to block that outand when you go like totally commit andhave no second guessing otherwise if youif you second guess yourself it\\'s uhthat\\'s when it can becomedangerous it\\'s also having that uhunderstanding to know this is not a goodone like kind of a discipline like youyou can get into a bad situationrelatively easy out there uh you mightnot be able to get out totally but yeahI think uh yeah it\\'s just it\\'s got thiswhole other these whole other teeth toit and there\\'s so many different facesof pipeline I mean it\\'s just it\\'s suchan incredible wave um but yeah justHawaii in general like I just I\\'ve beendrawn here every year since I was 12years old to come and surf these wavesand to be able to go and surf pipelinesurf sunset surf outer reefs like allwithin the space of a week and then surfa sandbar that\\'s twoot and fun like youcould literally bring every single boardto Hawaii and like go out yeah ride themmall and just that\\'s what I\\'ve alwaysloved about it I also love that it\\'swarm I hate the cold and it\\'s justliterally bloody Paradisehere well if that\\'s not a a you couldalso go boo

heavier out at your your youryour record winning wave at Himalayas orat pipeline I think uh Himalayas forsure but I just there so much adrenalinegoing through your body when you\\'re outat those waves that it actually turnsyou into like some sort of like weirdsuperum that doesn\\'t feel anything likewhen I was at jaws surfing the firsttime I my I got my my knee blown topieces and took like 15 minutes for meto realize that it was like I knew ithurt at the start but then it kind ofwent away and then the adrenaline kickedin and then when it wore off I was likeoh my God my knee\\'s like actually likedone yeah I\\'m out for 6 monthsyes as you can see uh we\\'ve seen in thisheat crossed up swells wind now it lookslike some weird Lake Placid uhwe\\'ll we\\'ll take a second to check inwith our contest director NathanFletcher who was with an actual livinglegend Mr RoyRussell all right we\\'re here with aspecial guest one of my favorite HeroesRory the dog Russell and so we justcrowned a pipe master and just for uhthe sake of pipeline we have a two-timepipe Master we want to ask him what whatit\\'s like to be a two-time pipe Masterwell to tell you the truth Nathannothing really changes me that much butit is quite an you know anaccomplishment and looking back at allthe years man it makes me proud to havebeen part of the whole deal it\\'s a veryvery important contest I thinkit it explains surfing to the very coreBonsai pipeline mangnarly and so what do you think of whatthe kids are doing doing out here thesedays compared to what the guys weredoing in your day what\\'s the differencein that well the the size of thesurfboard mostly the surfboards are somuch smaller now and the guys are takingoff so late before it was like we wereriding aircraft carriers you know we getinto the way real easy which was greatbut these guys nowadays are just pushingthe limits man these takeoffs they\\'remaking it just under tiptoes I mean it\\'sjust incredible what they\\'ve beenpulling into especially today the sechgetting really really T and uh they\\'repulling off some really amazing ridesout here Eli I mean Emi and everybodyelse man topnotch really proud of thesekids they\\'re really defining the Bonsaiin Bonsai pipeline totally Mr EO and hisBonsai ride was incredible man that wasall time heads up is is there any adviceyou want to give to the up and comingingkids pick the right wave man it\\'s all onpicking the right wave very importantfor you to sit there and study the surfbefore you battle out I\\'d spend hoursbefore i\\' battle out looking at the surfwaiting for the right time it\\'s a 45minute on 45 minute off type deal outhere they were mentioning that the otherday kale and who she was talking toabout each every other heat is is notenough again there weren\\'t enough ways atotally different uh type of swell Imean to totally type of different typeof sets coming in so basically a longtime ago Jerry used to stay stay out inthe water for like hours at a time and Ijust go out for an hour catch my wavesand come in and I told him one time Isaid it\\'s a 45 minute deal 45 minutes on45 minutes off so if you get in one ofthose Heats where it\\'s sudden the 45minutes off you know more power to youyou know but basically pipeline isn\\'tgood all day long it\\'s a it\\'s it\\'s avery fickle lady and she has theirmoments and it\\'s like basically as faras timing it\\'s a 45 minute dealall right well thank you Rory we reallyappreciate you coming down pick theright wave you\\'re in and I reallyappreciate you inviting me down been 60years standing right here looking atthese waves prettydeat all right thank you all rightyou\\'re welcome folks thank you Nathanand thank you that that was the legendtwo-time pipe Master Roy Russell puttingyou on game what a lord I mean how howhow about all those gem nugget he\\'s likehey oh my gosh I should I should havegot him to coach me he\\'s like on whatplanet do you think this wave just staysthe same allday and right now you could argue thatwe\\'re kind of in a 45 minutesoff Mason trying to turn that around ohjust love watching May surf he alwaysrides like a lot bigger boards and heget so small towards that Center thatsweet spot on the board after he makesthe drop he just moves up and justvirtual nose ride yeahoh look at the air vacuum his hair waslike sucking backwards how he gets up onthe front of thatthing there is there is a world where hemight have made it up over thatbump yeah I\\'m I\\'m sure he has a a storyof why it didn\\'t work out the way it didbut what a what a shot that is thoughyou see his hair like vacuuming sufferback he\\'s literally blow dryeryeah what\\'s great about Mason\\'s storiesis 3 seconds he could talk for 30minutes about how fromevery I heard he was classic in thebooth the other day when coko and I weresurfing so good all right with eightminutes to go if I\\'m Michael FebruaryI\\'m like really is this what\\'s happeningbecause yes he\\'s in that third spot butwith the heat stillleft there\\'s not safety for for for heor Mikey Wright um and you know he justwants to like put a little something onit I\\'m a bit blind what does it say heneeds tobetter 14 well he doesn\\'t need to betterhe\\'s in third but but he wants to likehe would like to put a little sauce onit maybe replace that15 that he has with a 20 he\\'s also got aa 14 point something you know he\\'s gotthat nice high score of a 24um but it would I\\'m I\\'m super biased butI want Mike febuary in the in in thefinal really bad as does all of SouthAfrica yeah there we

what doesthat do uh I think it just kind ofdisrupts your takeoff you you have aline you want it all nice and smooth ifnow you have something kind of coming upthe face that is going to inhibit youfrom getting that like maximum power todrop into the wave even a small littleRipple sometimes that your nose couldjust bury into the water to pull youback like that could be the differencebetween getting a nice entry intoholding you up just a tad being too deepor not even making it to your feet youcan really see it from this angle thatwhite water capping from the side Shoreand this is kind of what the theprevailing winds are expected to be overthe the next week stronger from thisdirection so we\\'re kind of in the thewindow right now that it\\'s manageablewith swell uh which is why I thinkNathan opted to want to hold ittoday well will somebody be able to makeamove see knowah having a looktherehere we go something\\'s happening we gotMasonscratching getting pumped oh he didn\\'twantit will one of thesewaves offer a cleanly opportunity thatcould provide somedifference in our lineup Mason on theboil still a bit too deep see now thesemore Northerly Direction sets arebreaking a little bit off of The Reeffrom the the spots that I\\'msure those nice West swells coming inthey\\'re they\\'re moving more Norththey\\'re not quite on those the typicalWest swell spots it\\'s shifting it seemslike throughout the day yeah we\\'ve seenin the last couple of hours there weresome of those those those more keennorthwesterly ones and then just pureNorths kind of bouncing back andforthyeah again when we look at theseforecasting the buoys may say Northwest6 feet 16 seconds but that\\'s an averagethere\\'s still going to be things thatare a little shorter period longerperiod from a different angle uh so it\\'salso uh what some people like to doincluding myself is to look at the rawdata not just look at averages go in andopen up and just look at all the numbersand see what the things are are lookinglikebecause an average can skew which isanother reason why it\\'s so great aboutthis competition it\\'s uh cumulativethere\\'s noaveraging that my friends is what youcall science dater welcome to thedater 43 seconds to go wow we we arefrustrated for these athletes um becausewe just want to keep on losing our mindsyeah all day I mean the performancesthat we\\'ve gotten to see all day long

downstairs with Holly rightnowha I mean sorry do you see that yeahanyway but how is it to have a heat likethat and then on your I mean be sittingin the water for the a wave like thatright after yeah I mean our heat waspretty uneventful but then the mostaction was like the last 2 minutes justafter I heat I remember seeing Seth goon that first one and I saw has kind ofdeep I was like oh no he missed it andthen and Seth got a crazy one and thenhas just got the most perfect like Idon\\'t know like I was in the barrel withhim I was literally just staring at himin his eyes and he had I thought hewasn\\'t going to make it and then justgot SP out it was insane yeah I\\'m sostoked for him that\\'s so good and uhyou\\'re still in Forth but uh how youfeeling um I don\\'t know I\\'m I\\'m stoked Imean you had a really fun day the otherday and I feel like it\\'s all about Idon\\'t know I\\'m just enjoying all themoments here and even just seeing hasyou know get that one was super sick soI don\\'t know we\\'ll see what the day doesand hopefully guys get more good wavesand I guess that\\'s what this format\\'sabout really but I mean I\\'m sureeveryone wants to win 100 Grand too butyeah and feo they want to know do youever getangry um yeah I get angry I don\\'t knowevery now and again but it\\'s not thatoftenyeah all righty beautiful thanks a havea good rest of your day thank you verymuch and in the studio here I have withme the one and only contest directorpipeline extraordinaire one of my bestfriends Mr Nathan Fletcher how are youdoing sir I\\'m good uh I just came in Iwas told to come in to explain thebackstory on Harry\\'s board okay let\\'shear it and the backstory is is uh Harrywas taking me through South Australiaand uh our car we broke down ourradiator was bad so we uh pulled intothis town pinong where they have one gasstation then across the street is thehotel slpb that we were stuck at for 3days and so we were uh at the hotel Puband then we come to find out there\\'sthis shaper Paul grel who his shapingroom was right next door to the pub andI think the town consists of maybe twoor 300 people and so we\\'re at the puband this guy comes in and Harry\\'stalking to him next thing you know wewalk out of the pub and we go to thisguy\\'s shaping room next door and thenHarry bought one of his used boards andhe gave us The Rundown and I think he\\'sbeen doing hand shapes for about 50years and since then Harry\\'s built arelationship with this guy and then uhhe\\'s gotten custom boards and it lookslike it really paid off well for him andsay and uh it\\'s kind of a real you knowunknown shaper but it looks to be whatHarry needs you know magic feather itlooked like it worked very well on thatwave there 30 points nonetheless aperfect score score I mean it looks likehe\\'s found those magic carpets downsouth now now Harry only needs a 12.6 toget back up to the fourth spot so verydoable but on another note as well onhis board it looked like a little bitmore board really worked for him you seehim he didn\\'t Bobble or uh it wasn\\'t aproblem getting into the biggest wave ofthe day or the biggest barrel of the dayum it really worked in his Advantagewhere you see a lot of guys riding inthe 66 68 range and that once you hitthat foam right there with a smallerboard your history that big board kindof carries you through all that chatterand if you look I believe it\\'s apolished gloss coat glass on finstotally you know \\'90s kind of era boardbut it really worked in that situationand so it might even go back to wherepeople are riding a little bit biggerboards on the bigger days instead ofalways just trying to ride at leastamount of board as possible I know uhMason ho will opt for a big board ohthat\\'s experience that\\'s secondgeneration knowledge right there youknow so he\\'s no stranger to surfing biggnarly pipe and neither is his dad andso I know that they talk about it athome and go over it and uh colaniChapman\\'s another guy that rides abigger board out there and get someridiculous barrels yeah especially whenit\\'s windy like this you got to catchthe wave you got to be in down the faceyou don\\'t want to be pulling around atthe top you don\\'t want to be doing nobackslide boogies I seen uh what\\'s hisname Michael febrary get a wave and ifhis board would have held he would havegot a awesome score but it Sid slippedit looked a little small and uhunfortunately wasn\\'t able to engage thefins and ride out of that one so thesebigger boards even Moana if you look ather boards you can tell it was a littlebit longer and it was it was carryingher through those barrels that\\'s anotherthing that I saw too a lot with thegirls um you know it seemed like theswell was rising and it seemed likethey\\'re all on pretty small boards andyou saw the difference with Moana whereyou want to ride the wave you want tocatch it and ride it and kick out and uhit\\'s really hard when you\\'re trying toride the most uh high performance andreally defined shape all that stuff kindof goes out the window when the wind andthe wave and everything\\'s just jackingand you can\\'t see you\\'re paddling in anduh it really looked to be in Harry\\'sadvantage to be on the equipment that hewas on well I bet some of the girls inthat in some of those Heats you knowwatching the waves all day cuz it reallyjumped up in a couple of those women\\'sHeats you know a couple aoup a couplefeet like it this swell really startedto fill in so it probably caught acouple of them off guard you know 100%when it\\'s coming up the waves are movingmuch faster than on the resding side ofthe swell so you just want to catch itand Wrangle that thing and go you don\\'twant to be uh Dilly dallying around atthe top but you know what maybe backsideit is easier to get away with a smallerboard because you\\'re grabbing your Railand you\\'re driving but I feel like frontside you really need the right equipmentwell thank you so much Nate for joiningus in the studio here as you can see ourbeautiful uh broadcast Bo excellent calltoday oh thank you yes there wasdefinitely speculation but the call wasmade couldn\\'t have made a better call itis what it could asked for a better dayfor the pipe Masters and especially forthe women I thought that uh moana\\'sperformance today was a second to andreally made history for women surfingyeah well thank you very much NathanFletcher and don\\'t go away we will seeyou right back here at the Vans pipeMasters 2023 from the beautifulNorthshore of Oahu inhavai here we have the trhy um fromlashi I feel like trophies on everythingbut there\\'s certain trophies that ignitethe the memory of like certain storiesand it\\'s my proudest one I think becauseit was like the most time that Iprobably spent trying at one specificlocation I feel pretty honored to havewon that event because they invited allthe women that are potentially the bestat part so it was definitely one to winwinning it again it\\'s a massive ask butI did it once so why not again and umyeah I just think it\\'d be crazy that\\'sdefinitely something I want to dobecause I don\\'t know I like taking onthat[Music]challenge welcome back to the Vans pipemasters from the Bonsai Pipeline on theNorthShore of Oahu inHavi in the water now we are in roundthree of men\\'s heat five set mon in thelead Harry Bryant right behind him insecond second share fall in third andEton Osborne in fourth as you heard fromthe Beast Marshall or maybe not shareand Eton are combed out of positionright now they need three big scoreseach to even think about uh moving intothe next round into our finals up andriding we have shareif here on asmoker unfortunately it closes out onhim Harry Bryant needs a 126 which would be a 43 32 3 and23.1 that woulduh really do it for him no he\\' need afour point something 4.24.2 what would do it anduh seeing how he\\'s been surfing if he beif he\\'spatient that 4.2 should be no problem toso equal12.4 and it\\'s crazy he\\'s got 12.80 12.10so he has a score up there that couldhave been used 310 of apoint not enough and uh paddling forthat wave we had one of our Surfers inblue if I\\'m not mistaken Aon Osborne wasgoing for thatleft here we go Harry Bryant broughtHarry looking for that score from behindhe\\'s in he\\'s up and he is going on astraight hander that is not going to getthe score he is looking for that is notthe one and uh still 11 minutes 20seconds remaining now 11 minutes and 20seconds remaining time to get back outthere and get thatscore what what heats after this one isthis the uh the flooring seat coming upI thinkwe get the honor of calling the FlorenceBrothersluau as they\\'re about to hit the lineupand feast the band of beards is going tobring it that unruly pipeline little bitnorth little bit north winds little bitsand on the reef there\\'s not exactlyperfect conditions by any means but thewaves arefiring lots of scoring potential onhand Kell what do you see in this thislast Heat how it just absolutely turnedon and shuffled the leaderboard aroundthat was C like the first five minuteswas just crazy like hugescores the leaderboard was just jumpingall over the place guys were in guyswere out I mean soexciting yeah it\\'s definitelya a spectacle when the waves go off outhere and they start firing as we wouldsaywhen all Surfers have the opportunity tocatch big waves big barrels and get bigscores that\\'s what it\\'s all about hereat the Vans pipe Masters2023 and just a little law in the actionpipeline it just woke up CCH catchingits breath from that flurry catching itbreath it\\'s definitelyuh been putting out a lot of energythese last few Heats and it seems likeit turns on and it turns off right nowit\\'s not really at the point where it\\'sjust kind of firing throughout theday yeah there\\'s some Heats where it\\'s alittle slow and then other Heats whereit\\'s justbanging yeah this seems to be a heatthat was banging and now they areprobably banging on theirboards trying to create some uhvibration in the water to bring thosesetsalongsee everybody some cheers in thebackground on thebeach we got somebody on the insidesomebody taking thisone sharq is up and he is down I am nottoo sure have to see who that Surfer wasonthis lastwave looked to be Sharfall uh look like Nathan Florence is offof the egg shaped funsize board and he\\'sback on a very seriouslooking none other than John pisel ThreeBrothers will be riding pisel surfboards here\\'s a replay of that last waveK yeah justclamped no noexit on screen MrNathan Florence GoPro in I would say inhand but inmouth anduh hopefully we get some insights fromthat GoPro and hopefully we get someinsight in one of them are mikedup it would be amazing it once againHarry Bryant only needs12.6 7 Minutes Advance into our finalfour spots 7 Minutes 42 secondsremaining can HarryBryantpull the rabbit out of thehat if anybody can brought a Harrycan and uh that\\'d be wild to have thehighest score of the entire contest butnot make the final but happens like Isaid you could have a 10 still not makeit yeah here we go set mon is right offthe bat I mean this was seconds into theheat righthere look at that so committed so stuckto thewave was perfectpositioning he knew exactly where hewanted and where he wanted tobe but right here BR Bryant let\\'s go braHarryBryant I didn\\'t think he was coming outdidyou never doubt Harry Bryant I meanthese guys so deep these guys come froma place that the waves are absolutelyfiring as well so Barrel riding skills Idon\\'t doubt any of these guys in thisevent that they\\'re not going to makewaves they\\'re all so good and it justtakes that one section to let youthrough yeah but that section where itkind of spit and and the spit came outalmost before him and then there wasanother section then you saw his boardcome after the spit that\\'s what kind ofpushed him out of the barrel was thatspit and that foam was driving forwardinstead of him being on the backside andfalling off it kind of caught under hisboard and kind of was like a little uhlike a little floor escalator you knowin the airport when you\\'re tired youdon\\'t want to walk there\\'s those flatescalator people mover yeah it\\'s like hejumped on one of those and it just kindof right through thebarrel it did look like he had a littlestring har Bryant looking like HarryHoudini yeah it looked like he had alittle string attached to the nose ofhis board just like pulling him along ohyeah there is definitely a string tryingto pull him off his board but he hand onhere he is again I\\'m not sure what\\'s upwith this wave selection here by HarryBryant brother you need a small wavejust a bar will come out to make it tothe top four let\\'s get back out thereholdposition and choose a wave that\\'s goingto be a score that\\'s going to let youout there\\'s not thatmany got to go out there and search anduh even those inside double UPS I\\'vebeen seeing are sick and I think thatyou can get a 12 on one of those easy oh4.2 yeah that\\'s uh he\\'ll probably dothat with his eyes closed I I\\'ll beguessing here comes that currentno Porto Escondidois Harry Bryant better paddle cuz thatis not the place you want to be when theset comes in you will get absolutelysmoked you see that wind how it\\'sstarting to crumble down the end of theWavesyeah yep here comes the north notgetting the easy the Northeast windswith the north more Northerly angledwestwell I would say little West withthat Northern tail on itand it will definitely shut the wavesdown the thing about this Northerlydirection is you don\\'t want to sit toodeep yeah there\\'s no sense sit way backthere unless you can get reallylucky for the most part the waves willbe breaking more towards the middle ofthelineup and uh towards the middle of thepipeline lineup That is not too fartowards off the- wall and not too fartowardshookai kind of just right right in themiddle and uh Derek hole was always goodat finding that uh end middle section asof late and he would just absolutelydominate Derek was out there justgetting insane waves all the way upuntil the end of his life like stilljust charging everysession one of the best out here atpipelineoh yes iing to be doing it at his age atthat high level still at that levelstill it\\'sinsane here we go 3 minutes and 22seconds will the Cinderella will theCinderella storyunfold for the one Harry Bryant whoneeds just a 12.6 just a 12.6 and itlooks like theocean it\\'s not really cooperating butright here if this ishim if this is Harry Bryant he gets tohis feet he\\'s got achance nope sorry buddy damn that\\'s gotto be so frust year that\\'s got to be sofrustrating he\\'s had three like thatthey just did not offer up the scoringpotential like I said some people willhaveperfect scores and still don\\'t make itto a final or make it out of theheat well however it shakes out he\\'sgoing to feel like a winner todaygetting the highest score of the contesta perfect 30-point ride I mean that wavewill be all over the Internet and goingviral really shortly here and um youknow he\\'ll still get the notorietyhe\\'ll be knownto have the best wave of the eventregardless of making the finals or not Yand uh yeah I think that\\'s the beauty ofthis event right now especially withthis format 2 minutes left Harry BryantImean he could get one come to him anduh make it all happen you know sky isthe limit right now this next wave lookslike a pretty sick one the shape on itis like uh it\\'s definitely going toBarrel but ashare uhheld offHarry I bet Harry I bet Harry was likego please don\\'t get it please oh my goshplease let me havethis and oh my gosh what was that lookslike a it\\'s getting a little bumpy WithThe Wind that looks like the board wentbackwards and it was not the right boardfor pipeline maybe for airs but not forhere and uh that\\'s what happens when youhave the wrongequipment it ends up going the wrongdirection one minuteremainingHarry brought aHarry look there\\'s Harry on the insideright there har like looking over hisshoulder like please don\\'t get it pleaselet me go and Sharie is like 6\\'8 and hejust was like I\\'m catching that forsure let\\'s see what happened herenothing pulled out Harry would have beenin that thing right there gettingdrained that would have been his 12point oh my that would have been his12.6 and the worst thing is shareifnever even had a chance to make it tothe finals but you can\\'t give anythingto anybody in these events this is acompetition anduh well looks like our Harry Bryant willbe going home ladies and gentlemenwow just goes to show you what one waveis does not do the trick here you needat least two waves and some backupscores what a heatthough Harry\\'s got to be stokedanyways wave of a lifetime you are rightwave of a lifetime that probablywouldn\\'t have went down on a regularsession four people out Harry was

got some TanLines there we go NastyNate oh that was a nasty wave that wasan absolute smoker technical drop and hesomehow got out the back there theseFlorence Brothers never seem to amaze meby what they can pull off and Emil isjusthe thought he was that chopes rightthere taking off under thelip but I think that was a MOA leashonly the leash got barreled on that[Laughter]one well the waves are picked up thewind is picked up a little bit ohoh coming in little uncharacteristic ofthese Florence boys coming in hot flyingthrough the air it almost I wish JohnJohn was miked up he probably wasselling those waves to his brothers likeyeah go go go yeah this a good one nowJohn\\'s in pull position I want to seehow this is going to play out if areally good set comes are they justgoing to let JN John do JN John andabsolutely smoke most people like he\\'sdone for so manyyears Mr John Florence out there in theblack we have another replay of Nate\\'snasty wave that thing is bottomed outright there he was not making out ofthat it sucked back too much foam I meanlook at that just barely makes a droppulls up and right there that white washjust says see you laterRaider and Nate is down and with the Moaleash you see his leash getting barreledthere and then uh our sideview that was a steep vertical drop wowlook at that pounding guys from thepoint to the channel Thatwave anduh I know maybe these guys have acompetition of who can get the most HangTime on the drop you neverknow LOL in the action again LW in theaction again there\\'s no lws in the boothwe want to introduceone of the North Shore\\'s uhfinest and uh a boy that I watched growup watch his father absolutelyrip the entire world topieces and uh I want to Welcome to thebooth Mr Noah Bashan what\\'s up guyshow\\'s it going what\\'s going on we\\'rewe\\'re wondering the same thing what\\'sgoing on out there buddy how was thewaves uh I meanmy heat didn\\'t have much waves just nowso you know it\\'s it\\'s the ocean someHeats are firing some Heatsaren\\'t um I feel like I was kind of Ithought I was blowing in my heat becauseI didn\\'t get anyways but then I came inand a lot of my friends were goingthere wasn\\'t there weren\\'t really thatmany waves in your heat so there werthat many waves your heat and literallyas soon as the horn blew it was just BamBam Bam guess what if you guys wouldhave had that extra 2 minutes you hadthe otherday I know that would have changedeverything the difference two minutescan make out here at Pipeline and we\\'retalking to Noah Bashan one of the bestto do it out here Noah um looking at theleaderboard here who do you think hasthe best chance of of shaking up thisleaderboard knowing that we only havemaybe four more Heats to go um Imean I think anyone can really it\\'s justif if they\\'re in the right place at theright time you know it\\'s like right nowit\\'s kind of all over the place so Ithink all these guys are capable ofmaking these waves is Baron coming up inthe heat soon yeah Baron and matah so wegot Nathan right here pingFlorence talk to us about the little bitof a North crumel it has on the wavepeople are kind of wondering why youknow it looks so perfect coming in nicebig set and then it just kind of closesout what is that it\\'s just the northwind you know North Wind kind of cominga little on Shore and crumblingcrumbling the barrel making it not asnot as pretty and nice as as you\\'d wantit but how much more difficult is it torideal wave that has those chandeliersand those crumbles in it it\\'s it\\'s a lotmore difficult if you have to bepunching through white waterer sectionsI mean you you guys know that but I meanif the wave\\'s hollow enough then youshould be able to get through that andopen up a little bit give you a littlebit of room sometimes you hit achandelier think you\\'re coming throughand it\\'s like a brick wall and you\\'relike where did that brick wall come fromin the ocean and little do you know ifyou\\'re moving fast enough the ocean canturn into pretty much concrete and thesewaves are stop you right in your tracksthis wave will stop you in your tracksforever if you\\'re not careful and uhyeah Noah Bashan got a sick wave talk tous about that back door wave uh we hadwho was in the booth with us somebodywas in here and was like I could havewent right on that one but it didn\\'t gowho else was in your heat with you oh itwas it was Mason it was was in the Heatand he was like I was looking and Iwasn\\'t I was going to go and oh my Godthat\\'s what that wave turned into he wasbaffled when he watched it yeah yeahthere all deeper than me and I waspretty wide and then I just got a chipinto it and I had like a little split ohIvan it just got way too casual on thatone did he get a brick wall I like Ibarely caught the end of it but that waslike a bat to the Head morelike it did look like somebody that waslike a false crack in school you\\'rewalking not looking and then not comesout of nowhere Nate\\'s Nate\\'s wave alittle earlier that he didn\\'t make lookpretty crazy too his drop yeah that wasa super let\\'s see what up in here walkus through this no um he\\'s justcruising and then just pipe it just didsomething weird it\\'s like that song whatisit yourhead got he stood Too Tall he stood TooTall too casual and took a lip to theHead well pipeline moves a lot peopledon\\'t know that this wave breathes so itlooks big then it gets almondy and itgets small and it\\'ll breathe you backand\\'ll open up and spit you out over aledge and uh that\\'s the kind of way I\\'dwatch the replay myself and justgo damn it if if anybody can tell ourwater camera out there to lick his lensof all the water shot so nice and blurrymy wipe out in Tahiti where I ripped myface off was one like that where I justgot a little high wasn\\'t even that bigof a way but just got a little too highin the barrel lip just barely clippedthe head but sent me pile drive it\\'sfunny when that happens to it\\'s likeIan\\'s so good he probably thought he wasjust going to cruise through that waveand then it just he looked like he wasjust cruising cruising and then it justdid something weird and boom does it notseem like every time you\\'re like justcruising or like you feel like you canjust relax in the bars somehow it Clipsyou in the head you come out feet firsthow many times have you\\'re like you knowwhat I mean you\\'re thinking you\\'recoming out talking about coming out ofbarrels BR Harry Bryan Holly we want toknow how it feels to be BR Harry Bryantright nowhas man is that the board you got in thepub it\\'s the guy that made me the boardfrom Pub but yeah Paul grael from pongmade me this board and I kind of when Igot this board I kind of felt like I wasgoing to get to wave my life on itsooner or later but didn\\'t think it wasgoing to happen today but yeah thevision from inside that tube was crazyI\\'m like kind of can\\'t even reallybelieve can\\'t even really believe thatit

beautiful H thank youappreciate it brother Harry I mean Noahthat wave right there that\\'s what dreamsare made of that\\'s the kind of stuffwhen you go to elementary school youdraw on your B book that\\'s the stuff nomatter how good of a wave you get youwant to get another one like that andright here during theinterview little small barrel for oneNathan Florence looking to uh mayberedeem himself in those last fewwaves anduh kind of side slipped got in thebarrel he\\'s going to be looking for abetter one than that I could tell yourightnowYeah It\\'s Tricky out there he\\'s justtrying to trying to find something yeahtrying to get something going somemomentum huh yeah make one make two andthen the bomb comes or right here Ithink they know John\\'s uh in pullposition outback he\\'s uhwaiting for the one he\\'s looking prettygood with 57 points um I\\'m sure he\\'sgoing to want to overtake Billy he\\'sdefinitely not going to want to uh stayin third because is you know you get upin that top spot there\\'s three PE fourpeople that still got to take you overyou\\'re in third only two people whenyou\\'re in fourth you\\'re really bitingyour nails everyheat once again we are here in studiowith NoahBashan welcome Noah to the studio Noah\\'sbeen walking us through uh kind of whatit was like out there in this heat whatit was like to ride some of these wavesand um tell us about um is thereanything else you got going on any partsdropping anything interesting that uhhas been happening lately um well meAndy Woodward and um Gabe Caswell wecame out with a movie project that we\\'vebeen working on for the last like yearand a half so that\\'s on Red Bull TVright now and um we\\'ll put out adirector\\'s cut in in April oh nice yeahso that\\'s pretty much it we did aPremiere here beginning of winter andjust filming and surfing and justfreaking having been fun beautiful welove it but um we\\'re going to watch yourwaves here from earlier on in the eventand maybe have you walk us through a fewof thesewaves um there yougo yeah Imean I mean that back door wave I prettymuch just yeah just took off the onehigh pump you at the end and you justpunched you\\'re like man that was thefirst time I rode that board too and Iwas just like wa this board works sickand then that\\'s yes that\\'s the otherwhen it was smallerripping showing us you can kill it inthe the variety we had on tap for thisevent yeah yeah Frick this day there\\'scrazy ramps I didn\\'t really get any anyproper sections but cuz I was going on amillion waves like every w i thedifference what\\'s the difference incompeting like the first day 6 to8perfect second day small airs ManeuversThird Day pumping in Wild how is it toadjust your strategy throughout those 3days knowing the um what is needed youknow knowing what the judges are judgingon how do you kind of adjust yourstrategy to that I think for I mean forme specifically and like my friends wegrew up here on the NorthShore you knowlike so for us it\\'s kind of just likeanother day you know like every day isdifferent on the NorthShore one day it\\'sgood for airs one day it\\'s good forbarrels so you kind of just wake up andsee what what the deal is and and ifit\\'s firing pipe sick and if it\\'s 3otlittle back door with wind to the rightsI\\'m just as psyched so so yeah sohowever it is it\\'slike we\\'re we\\'re lucky over here we haveso many different styles of wave so manydifferent styles of Surfing that that wecan do so was pretty cool to see allthose different styles highlighted hereat this event with that kind of smallerdays with a big like you\\'re seeing onyour screen kind of wild unruly biggerpipeline and then uh that perfect firstday but uh yeah we enjoy your surfing weenjoy all your content that you createand you put out Noah you\\'re just aoutstanding guy not just in the waterbut out of the water too real respectfulkid and always you know seem to be doingthe right things here we go I\\'ve beenwriting and mail talking about doing theright things that was a wrongthing maketime I appreciate that though M thankyou no it\\'s all you man we\\'re justgiving the credit where the credits doand uh your father and your mom suchawesome family know your brother outthere doing his thing too so aloha tothe Bashan family if you folks arewatching Uncle gav as well in his littletribe but here\\'s John John this is theone he was waiting for this istojn is that his first wave that\\'s hisfirst wave god wow 20 minutes later 19minutes and 40 seconds later John Johncat is his first wave anduh I think it\\'s going to be better than20 points a 15 points he\\'s back he\\'s gota 15 Pointbackup yeah he\\'s definitely at a 19 wowhe\\'s definitely going to lose that 15and replace it with no real real highscores all put together huh this look atthat drop I mean butter Fu I mean thefact that how Wild and and likedifficult it is out there for him tojust catch his just wave is not wholetime and C his first wave and that\\'s itthat smooth look at this look at thewind not a bobble out ofplace nothing 100% control look at himon that foone ball just like it I wouldhave got fcked look at that fooneball he just comes I mean look at thattries that little rotation at the endit\\'s really hard to beat John John outhere especially in a format like thiswhere you carry scores over cuz he\\'sgoing to get one or two each heat and alot of the times it\\'s just bad luck on abackup score or this or that that youknow John John usually but in a freelook how far forward his foot front footis you have to be you got to be upforward to get that momentum you cannotbe back on your grip right here h noyou\\'re on the back of your board you\\'lljust Wily right there and then rightthere he\\'s just ha he\\'s laughing rightthere he laughing right there watch thefoone ball starting to come up and underhis board and he he almost like slid alittle bit and then got it back undercontrol that guy\\'s so under control evenwhen it looked like he sliding out orhe\\'s going to do this or that he is sounder control it is insane yeah theboard control that JN John possessesit\\'s it\\'s un like any other yeah sitsituation under control oh yes thesituation is under controlnow I think he will be controlling oursituation if I\\'m not mistaken ooh barmate but but then you got two guys righthere that don\\'t give up who\\'s in thelead they are out for blood mat J andbaron boymamia two of the standout Premier BarrelRiders of thisgeneration anduh you know it\\'s just if the wave comeslike Harry Bryant said that wave choseme yeah straight up it it did it\\'s it\\'skind it\\'s kind of how it is where itcomes on the reef where you are on thereef at pipeline you know no 3 feet 2 or3 feet to the wrong side and you\\'re doneyou know 6 in out you\\'re done you\\'re toofar out like you just have to be in thatspot and look at that27.3 he is in first God I can\\'t wait tobe the chosen one yeah I know it\\'s crazyme and mace were tripping because we hadthat whole heat and then we didn\\'treally get much and then the heat endsand these sets come in and he\\'s Harry\\'sin the perfect spot and it\\'s just likehe did get he did get chosen he gotstraight Chosen and that wave was andthen he made the wave too though so itwas insane yeah I mean just where hedropped in everything was so smoothabout that wave it didn\\'t really givehim too much of a hard time even in therough spots it kind of carried him rightthrough that barrel and itjust Noah Dean he\\'s looking for I wonderif he drank one of the beers we rightjustnow I was laughing earlier he was onhere he was talking about how does yogaa couple a couple times a week coupletimes amonth it\\'s hard toconcentrate no sick so classic sotalented too was that Craig Andersonwith him tooyep got make time make time just gotthat one closeout he\\'s staying with me rightnow he\\'s a classic kid Meo yeah yeahyeah oh yeah he\\'s so sick and he\\'s thatbuck charges yo charges yeah he\\'ll go onwhatever my goodness I know it\\'s kind ofboming that it\\'s not really translatinginto a score line for him right now buthis charging is just especially inTahiti yeah it\\'s on a whole anotherlevel seesome line stackingup oh John John has jumped firstguys that\\'s rightJohn is now in[Music]first one wave could take any one ofthese competitors right now tofirst I mean 130 or 127 right now I meanyou\\'re back up theleaderboard Mikey February is on thesqueeze Patrol he\\'s infourth are those still his scores fromour firstheat I\\'m pretty sure there are y it\\'scrazy it\\'s crazy you can either get itall all in your last secondfirst whatever it\\'s kind of that\\'s whythe format\\'s so cool yeah it\\'s awesomeyou might have one bad heat and so whatyou can still win the contest you knowyeahyeah yeah he\\'s got to be these last fiveminutes are going to be going by reallyslow for Mikey February who is on thebubble in the fourthspot on the Cliff\\'s Edge of qualifyingfor the final ornot Nate Florence up been riding on alittle righthere he\\'s going to want to get one ofthose 27o rides here wasJohn\\'s big score that propelled him intothe lead in the VansJohn JohnJohnthey said he they said he wasn\\'t he wastoo cool for just one name they had toname him twice he is now your top of theleaderboard John JohnFlorence as if we couldn\\'t have bet onthat huh no surprise I wonder what theodds would have been of John John comingout in the lead after the preliminaryrounds if they if they bet on in Vegas Iwonder what what um one and 10 one inone and too I mean I\\'m sure they\\'rebedding somewhere right next door[Laughter]too oh John Florence in the lead Billykeer in second setm in third Michaelfebuary in the coveted fourth spot andhow he\\'s been hanging on to that thiswhole time is definitelyuh the question of the day so manytalented Surfers so many opportunitiesbut yet Mother Nature just not lettingthem get that score needed to you knowjump into that four spot and Michaelferary holding on to it respectively sohe was getting drained had a lot ofgreat waves and uh he\\'s deserving thespot that he\\'sin yeah he\\'s held on to that that topfour since day one which iscrazy I mean look looking at theseconditions right now Noah it\\'s superchallenging with the nwell with Northwinds to get any type of score huh yeahyeah 100% that\\'s why it\\'s like you seeNate there\\'s the strategy where you kindof go around and you just try to catchwaves and hopefully one kind of is goodand then there\\'s John where he just kindof waited to right here Ian I I oh he\\'sgoing wow make it down that one wasFluffy oh he was almost right there hisboard was shoveling through it maybe Idon\\'t know if it was him or his boardbutI seen his boardcoming that one look Fluffy from thefrom the GetGo from theGetGo that\\'s tricky it could be so badand then a really good wave could comein you know so it\\'s like as long as ithas that double up and that West angleto it the wind\\'s not as bad but whenthey\\'re stretched out and they\\'re alittle more like have a weak shoulder tothem that long weaker shoulder it\\'s kindof it\\'s almost a wrap especially downthere by that sandbar huh yeah let\\'scheck this out it was already crumblingoxit onno way he there there look oh yeahyou\\'re right yeah look good eyMak I don\\'t know if his board was ghostriding or if he was actually on itfor a little bittraveling yeah I definitely think thisformat though was really cool you knowlike you get to serve three timesguaranteed you know and then they theytake the the best four to the final it\\'slike everyone gets a pretty pretty goodshot I mean most other sports skateskateboarding snowboarding they\\'reusually ran like this yeah mhm theyusually ran where everybody surfes andyou know what the fans get to watchtheir favorite Surfer surf multipletimes just because they might have hadone bad heat whatever it may be you getthe engagement of the fans all the wayuntil finals day because you\\'re backwatching your favorite Surfer guaranteedevery day and I really think it gives alot moreexposure time on screen and um I thinkthis is just the way to go honestlywe\\'re here make time maybescratching let\\'s go come on make oh wowoh no that it\\'s not It\\'s Tricky cuz thesandar is pretty close that was like ano that is not what you want todo 30 seconds Corners out he looked likehe was becoming one with the lip rightthereand Florence and Ivan Florence therepipe Master\\'sdreams are coming to a close and onceagain they will have to watch theman their big brother John John Florencecarry that Florence flag fornow well that\\'s it for me and Ken B noanthank you very much for coming in andspending the time with us thank you guysfor having me round three heat seven onthe way and Salma masaka and Dr CLI Capoon for the call for the nexthman that means alot noit\\'s crazy to see him here I I literallyremember beingat World Championship tourevents when Noah Bashan was like threeyears old watching his father compete onthe championship tour and now to seewhat he\\'s become prettyawesome here we are round three heatseven matah from chopo Baron mamia CraigAnderson and Noah Dean and if you\\'reMichael February right now in thatnumber four spot you\\'re clenching oh Iwas with him I was with him that wholetime and as soon as the brothers as thebrothers Florence entered the water hewas just like oh man theseguys as wesayem oh might have got hurt yeah I saw akid walking up with a broken Board ofhis oh noso he\\'ll get some attention asthe being lookedat we\\'ll update you on hissituation and but how about IvanFlorence and Nathan Florence you knowsuper challengingconditions where they just threwthemselves into as many pits as theycould yeah they sent it that was youdon\\'t really see that from the FlorenceBrothers falling too often I mean wellthe waves I mean weren\\'t giv them NEnecessarily all the opportunities butthen John John\\'s like well look looklook what\\'s out here guysyeah they didn\\'t need the biggest scoresbut again at pipeline in generalsometimes those are the hardest scoresto get it\\'s the men\\'s field is tough thejudging is is noteasy or I would say it\\'s it\\'s not quitepredictable maybe for competitors yeahNathan Florence noticing that uh Mao isbeing tendedto make thatfirst what a day again if you\\'re justjoining us or you\\'ve been with us youyou knowpipeline has a billion faces and we haveseen all of them over the course of mostof them over the course of these uh 3days of competition but today has beenuniquely interesting as when we came tothe beach it literally was waste tochest high and this swell just startedbuilding and building and building asyousee perhaps the greatest surfer in theworld right now over all around JohnJohn Florence is now in that number onespotfocused on a pipe MastersChampionship when you see JN John uhagainst and standing next to otherhumans you realize not a small humanno thegrowth I think we all seen remember himfrom the uh thicker than water movieyeah 12 years old six 6 seven years oldwhen we first got to knowhim I remember that Surfer magazine Iremember when he got the cover of Surfermagazine I believe he was around 12years old and back then you know presocial media the cover was the mostcoveted spot photo incentives Etc andthere were a lot of people who werechirping how can a12-year-old get the cover that should beme and you know that that that coversaid hey this this this guy is thefuture it\\'s one thing to have the entiresurf media and the world say hey you\\'regoing to be the guy another thingentirely to live it and and build theLegacy uh that John John Florence hasand he is with Holly right now stoked inthat number one spot hey John uh firsttime Ser paryeah yeah I can only catch onewave umconditions what do you think it\\'s goingto be like in the final uh I think it\\'sgoing to be challenging it\\'s it\\'s gottenpretty challenging out there um there\\'smoments you know like watching HarryBryant W was incredible Seth got the onebefore then Harry got that one and likehad that little 10-minute moment youknow but this wind is uh always makes itreally difficult out here it just kindof has enough onshore to it where itmakes it crumble really hard and sounless you get the really bowly onesthat really open up it\\'s prettydifficult and uh what are you riding andwhat are you going to be riding in thefinal changing up or no keep it at thesame riding 66 uh next up pel um kind ofmy go-to pipe board and uh yeah there\\'ssome pretty good siiz sets coming rightnow and this there\\'s still a lot ofenergy from this swell filling in umso yeah hope for the best sick all rightthanks AESripping that was John John for I\\'m goingto destroy the field and win thisthing yeah um a few years back uh afootball player American football playerJimmy Graham asked me if I knew who uhJohnnyJohnny was hey who\\'s that Johnny Johnnyguy in your sport bro Johnny Johnny Iwas out on the trip CR well he wassaying he was hanging out with uh ReefMcIntosh uh and Cole at the pilver housebig football fan Reef pintas remember hehad the the collaboration signatureChargers I mean reef is the size of a afootball player a big easily could havebeen tight end I I had his uh hisQuicksilver Charger shorts back in theday but he uh he said I was hanging outwith my my boy Reef we were watchingthis little boy at the Triple CrownJohnnyJohnny he\\'s probably like 12 I was likewhen was this I guess it was a long timeago I like yeah he\\'s like 30now he\\'s like a multi-world championJohnny Johnny Johnny Johnny yeah thatJohnny Johnny\\'s done good for himselfbro uh special shout out to our onewonderful Partners here uh the Spectrumsurf channel here in Hawaii uh it\\'salways nice when you\\'re when you\\'re herein the Hawaiian Islands uh when you\\'rewatching the surf contest you don\\'t gotto go to your laptop just go right toyour TV and Spectrum uh broadcasting itas they would any major league sportsevent so we are grateful for them andeverything they\\'ve done uh to spreadthis band\\'s pipe Masters around to theHawaiianIslandsall the Surfers here in this heat needtwo waves to make the final which is whyMikey February was is breathing a slightslight side of relief because FlorenceBrothers just needed one respectivelyIvan andNathan I had also in talking to myFebruary that pipe wave that close outthat he packed he bounced really hard onthe reef showed me he had a littlecontusion scratch there on the hip andhe said oh it\\'s starting tothrob you know that\\'s thedance she can be nasty outhere but they may need two waves butthey are they are all Surfers who arefully capable oh yeah fully fullycapable Baron mamia of course gettingready for his third year on the WSLChampionshiptour his uhperformances not just at pipeline butSunset Aliva like he is uh he\\'s got allof thetools yeah and Craig Anderson againthe man any one of these mateDr they have oh Baron starting thingsoffquick reevaluating that decisionMikey was also describing what you\\'vebeen pointing out in these ribs that arecoming up the face from that that windis it it\\'s East Wind yeah yeah NortheastNortheast wind it\\'s actually it\\'s comingmore into across the face then offshoreout the back when you got a bit of Northin that easterly trades he wasdescribing just how challenging it istrying to just just to get into waveswhen you\\'ve got these big big ribs andthis crazy wind and then on top of itlike negotiating all this stillweirdness from the sand that\\'s left uhin thechannel yeah you can if you look closelyyou can see those so now you can see theintervals you see the water moving inreally short intervals moving from thebottom right of the screen to the topleft those are that\\'s the wind as welland it seems a lot smoother from theDrone but in the water those those aresignificant chops moving up the facethat\\'s the the prevailing trades andthen you have another Northeast kind ofswell crisscrossing alongside that andthen you have the per the the longinterval Northwest well so you havethree sort of swells in the water if youtake a look back and you kind of squinyour eyes you see patterns you see X\\'smoving across above the reef so but youalso do see that the sand is beingpulled off you we\\'re seeing we don\\'t seethose uh sandcrack or we don\\'t see the cracks filledwith sand as much anymore that has beenmoved off with those sets revealing nowmuch more defined and dangerous pipelinebottom we\\'ll get you an update on emozerx uh condition as he is being tendedto and with 17 seconds to gohereNoah Noah Deanscratching and dodging 17 minutes togo as John John said going to it ischallenging out there I love the factthat he said hey it\\'s super challengingbut when you see Harry\\'swave you know when you see his wavethere you got to you got to find thoseopportunities as we will take uh a shortbreak and return turn here in heat 7 atthe Vans pipe[Music]Masters I think it would be awesome tobe front side at pipe but also I lovebeing front side at back door it\\'s anadvantage to be a regular foot at pipeline you get to go front side at backdoor and then drag your ass H pipe andbeing compressed it\\'s easier to bebackside on a steep heavy drop becauseyou don\\'t have to get that extensionandoss air drop you can just stay closeand tight on your rail like you seeJamie who\\'s the best ever like hedoesn\\'t leave the face ever but frontside sometimes you\\'re just forced tobecause you have to be like open to thewave welcome back to a magical Tuesday alive shot of the beauty that is pipelinehere at the van pipe Masters we are inheat7 and uh some bombs coming out the backbut as Dr capona pointed out earlierwith all the triangles and movementthat\\'s going on it is unruly and hard topick out the gemsmhm we see there\\'s a bit of uh rollingthe dice today and some people it\\'s beenin their favor others not so much peoplescratching any which ways you got peoplegoing to the Channel people going to thebackdooragain these ribs moving across the faceare making extra difficult andchallenging but still if there was nocontest there would probably be 50people out right now at least 50 50 1002005,000 allhoping see this extra swell right infront of this breaking see that\\'s a thatthat\\'s something that you don\\'t want tosee taking off is an extra lump althoughI\\'ve seen Benjibran decide that those are the waves hewants at any given day and somehow getscrazy treats him treats him like adouble up yeah he\\'s just hoping that iteventually connects into one massivewave that he\\'ll somehow find his way tothe endofyou engage in something called Reefmodeling you\\'ve talked about before umwhat does that mean and how do you doit so Craig oh stand by Craig fadinggoing in onhis I mean stylish so stylish it makesyou thinklike is he doing anything in realityhe\\'s doing a lot I wonder what he\\'swriting but that looked really cool youcould see kind of kind of faded thattakeoff a littlebit Yeah I think he\\'s riding uh a Haydenshape looks to be a Thruster more foamup front sort of board would beinteresting to know if he\\'s opted toride a polyurethane board or a expandedpolystyren EPS orpu but yeah uh Reef modeling essentiallyis creating taking a series of imageslet\\'s see Craiglooking really getting into it easy andfinding that line and kind of hoping itstays open which it doesn\\'t but you dosee he did jump again these individualsunderstand hey I I have to get I have topenetrate these waves if I wantto stay safe out there but by taking aseries of photographs uh they can beinserted into a program and then they\\'reessentially stacked intothreedimensional models and what thebenefit of having threedimensionalmodels of the bottom mapped out overjust say a 2D image is you have extradimensionality to be able to see and gointo the different cracks and structuresof the reef we see here this is a a 3Dmodel of pipeline that crack right thereis the slab section which water movesthrough here causing a wave to reallyheave and throw a really wide Barrel souh again our lab called the mega labtries to find these features on the reefto be able to know where are the mostimportant Reef features that translateto perfect waves one of the things thatwe\\'ve seen over over the yearsespecially with with Kell you\\'ve heardKelly Slater talk about here and also atcloudbreak is describing them as fingersand knowing which ones to sit ondepending on what the swell is doingbecause of what the wave is going to doin that position yeah you start to seethat that uh traditionally we like tothink of uh Just Energy being tripped bya bottom a reef a rock structure asandbar but we\\'re starting now in themega lab we\\'re starting to uncoverspecific features within the reef thatare specific to certain parts of thewave at pipe you see it kind of cappingand it doesn\\'t really heave until acertain section we have now find certainre features below pipeline that time itjust perfectlywhere you kind of know okay the wavechanges its face once it comes intocontact of a specific re feature andthese Reef features aren\\'t justubiquitous they\\'re not just scatteredwilly-nilly throughout the reef they\\'reactually put in they they are found incertain areas which make the wave a bitmore predictable um that being said umwhen people triangulate again and findtheir land references it it correlatesreally well like in Kelly slers wavepool they say okay wait for the flagokay now it\\'s going to Barrel you hearrman or Kona saying now this is it asyou can see here this is that back doorsection where it\\'s all flat and you havea big channel here that sets apart ANSand off the- wall and all of thesefeatures and spur and grooves and cracksin the reef have a very specific role increating the waves that we see and we\\'velearned to surf out at Pipeline and backdoor how does this I mean this isincredible this ability to to to 3Drender uh what\\'s taking place underneathhow is that going to assist us in how weunderstand reefs around the world wellthere\\'s selfish uses and then there\\'s uhmore altruistic I guess uses some of themore broader impacts as we can start tounderstand how energy get gets diffuseduh to protect our coastlines you knowwaves they\\'re not just uh resources forus Surfers waves are resources from alot of coastal communities to disperseheavy energy and storms that occur inthe middle of the ocean they protect thecoastline they disperse again thatenergy in a in a way that doesn\\'t justcause beaches to get eroded orinfrastructure to get pulled out intothe sea so understanding more about howthese features um transfer energy anddissipate energy they can be implementedinto understanding where to build wherenot to build where restore and to takeaway from a surfing perspective uhfinding these features once we start toidentify key features that areconsistent at waves like pipeline acloud break kurukuru mangi what theycall it or tah which we\\'ve been mappingnow we can find those same re featuresusing satellites or drones or diving andsay hey there\\'s some potentially newwaves here that are are yet to bediscovered instead of waiting for a wavebreaking we can look at restructures tofind New Waves I love it you know Iremember growing up there were so manyconversationsespecially mid to late \\'90s early2000s um we thought we were going to seethis proliferation of artificial reefsuh structures that are man-made but putin the ocean to create some of ourfavorite waves in the world what hasbeen the hindrance in man being able toto to meet nature at nature no oneactually modeled it to understand okayI\\'m going to make a wave that is a goodwave they just throwsandbags it\\'s like it\\'s like soprimitive to think like Why didn\\'t itwork oh because they just are guessingjust random let just randomly throw somestuff Mother Nature is not random noit\\'s it\\'s it\\'s millions of years ofrefining uh so yeah they\\'re all allbenefits um it\\'s interesting and it\\'sjust something where you can map a reefwith a GoPro or you can map a reef withuh the camera you take to film eachother surfing anyone has the ability andthat\\'s what we are trying to do in ourlab is to share you can use the samecamera that you capture beautifulsurfing with you can also capturesomething that is going to help theenvironment understand more about ourHumanity so you know let\\'s Empowerpeople to know that you can have a goodtime and party for the planet at thesame time awesome and thank you for youryour wonderful Insight matal J L dropalmost goes nose heavy I mean it\\'s rareto see him NOSdive remember we are on a quest here uhto Crown a men\\'s Champion here at theVans pipe Masters and we\\'ve alreadycrowned uh a women\\'s champion anincredible final the women reallysetting the tone for what\\'s taking placetoday Aaron Brooks in fourth place withfollowed by Carissa Moore Molly Pam andMoana Jones Wong wow how\\'s moana\\'s wayslook at thisthingwow some people just have the Mana onthe day rightand look Imean those were some of the best wavesyet so far incredibleperformance$100,000 and now a twotime two time Vans pipe Master again asyou talked about to be a native Hawaiianthat kanaka that that uh how inspiringthat[Music]is oh and her her her best friends herhusband chairing her up the beach ahsuch a such an amazing end to thewomen\\'s competition and the legacy of ofof of the title is obviously the mostimportant thing being a pipe Master butreally have to like hand it to Vansespecially at a time in which the surfindustry finds itself in a bit of adrought it is not easy to be aprofessional Surfer uh these days butVan\\'s putting a primary Financialinvestment in the structure of thisevent and also uh for the pay and equalpay for the men and women 100,000 forfirst 75 50 25 um that\\'s life changinggamechanging money uh for all of ourcompetitors uh and we are grateful somuch just an honor to be able to sit inthe booth with you uh and tell thesestories as well oh I mean it\\'s I I evencan\\'t believe that we\\'re here speakingon behalf of these competitors for pipeMasters in an industry that is seeing alot of change across the landscape thereare still uh individuals andcorporations that are stepping up toensure the culture stays alive yeah andpipe Masters we we surfing wouldn\\'t bethe same if we didn\\'t have a pipe MasterCraig takingoff you had that Wing cranked ready togo mhm reminder to you at home our men\\'sfinal will be taking place in 90 minutesfrom now420 at 420 so I\\'ll say it again at4:20 our men\\'s final will be takingplace soprepareaccordingly you know what todocorrection look at that they throw usunder the bus our producers tell us onething and they\\'re like oh actually it\\'snot the final that starts at 420 it\\'sthe ceremony the award ceremony was Iwould doing the math I was like thatseems quick our award ceremony uh willbe taking place at 420 there\\'s abeautiful stage that was just builtYesterday by our crew just behind wherewe arecommentating and how about thiscrowdon aTuesday there\\'s a there is a Saturdaylike a Saturday style crowd here uh on aTuesday here on the NorthShore muchbigger crowd today uh than we hadyesterday and all passionate surffans these folks making the wisechoice I wonder what the ratio is offolks on vacation to like I don\\'t have ajob and that\\'s okay I can just come andwatch surfing I mean judging bythe look I would sayvisitors well who knows you know timesarechanging might be the new residence hereon the NorthShore I\\'m not touching itI\\'m not not touching it I\\'m not touchingit hey 2 minutes and 20 seconds to gohere in heat seven round three uh noadDean Baron mamia Craig Anderson matahdrle as you said we said earlier all ofthese Surfers are people who are lookingfor two scores uh to break into that topfour spot remember we\\'ve got MichaelFebruary who is sitting just just on thebubble there in the fourth spot how howis this only one one and a half minutesleft in this heat that that seemed tojust re next he\\'s going to befiring of course I mean you heard RoyRussell 45 minutes on 45 minutes off ohman Rory gave a gave a speech thissummer inHuntington he was was on his birthday 70years old and he stood up on stage andstarted off with I madeit I told[Laughter]you oh that man has lived a thousandlives and to see just how passionate andjoyful he is after all these years youheard him earlier being like hey 60years of watching this wave and havingrelationship with Pipeline and I mean hegave us such incredible context into howpipeline works and it he literally spokethe next two Heats into existence ifyou\\'re just joining us right now for areminder this is not your average WLevent this is a WSL sanctioned specialtyevent the Vans pipe Masters and here isjust a quick snap at how this eventformat[Music]works[Music][Music]that ends Heat s round three didn\\'tmanifest for the boys hereunfortunately sofrustrating for them to say theleast as again MichaelFebruary Seth Mon and Billy keer youknow they\\'re they\\'re allvulnerable all within a point of eachother John John with that what seemed tobe like just random pipe wave and in areallychallenging heat with his brothers andemo coming through with that27.9 to put him up at 68 points andchange as here we are in round threeheat8 can we get 45 minutes on Mother Naturecan we get 45 minutes on for BrunoSantos Lucas chanka FinnMcgill and MaPang all in we\\'ll see exactly what eachsererneeds yeah it looks like uh it\\'sinteresting to seeing the different finsetups the quad definitelyproviding a bit morespeed versus the Thruster which do youprefer in ways waves of consequence uhit depends for me on the speed mostlyfor waves that I feel you want to slowdown a bit more and personally get morecritical on drops I prefer Thruster uhfor waves that have a bit simpler oreasier entry but wanting to really drivethrough Barrel sections I would say quadsoin my mind um a wave like pipeline I\\'dprefer a Thruster and at the back door Iwouldn\\'t mind umquad allright I like a quad too in in when Ifeel like I really need to go fast andchop through somesections that extrapump well joining us uh in the boothright now the pride of SanClemente Kira pinkton hello happyTuesday to you welcome thank you so muchthanks for having me we are honored tohave you how would you describe thisthis Vans pipe Master\\'s experience foryou this year yeah I\\'m super excited tobe here I watched it all last year and Iwas kicking myself that I wasn\\'t in itand um the first day was insane secondday made it a little bit tougher cuz uhdidn\\'t really know where to surf andthen today was really good day to end itwhen you say you weren\\'t in it was itdid you not get an invite or did youhave an injury no I just didn\\'t have aninvite and I really wanted to be here sowhat did what what did that look likefor you to say I really want to be inthis what did that year look like fromDecember of last year to December ofthis year or whenever you got yourinvite what were the steps um well Imean this year I was doing a lot ofcontests so I wasn\\'t really um doingmuch in terms of barrels but I\\'ve beengoing to Indo a lot and so I\\'ve beenspending time out there learning andtrying to get barreled and I feel like Ifelt like I deserved to be here but umthis year I didn\\'t really do as good asI wanted to so I\\'m hoping I can step itup next time I like I thought it wasreally interesting that you made thechoice uh to put yourself in the waterwith three former pipe Masters was thatwhat was the your thought behind that umI just feel like when you\\'re in thewater with people who push you you kindof step it up a lot more and um Carissawasn\\'t in the heat yet when I chose itand so when she got put in there I waslike wow I really screwed myself herebut I was actually super stoked to be ina heat with them especially if I want tobe on the CT like they\\'re all CT Surfersand um yeah they were pushing me andthey\\'re all Hustlers it was fun wetalked a lotabout as we see I\\'m kind of paying latedrop oh you you literally saw the stepsthose ribs that you talked about as ashis board had to negotiate them and twosteps down he wasout what did you what did you learn Kirauh about pipeline in this experience umyeah I mean I haven\\'t really served pipemuch I hurt myself a long time ago hereand I kind of never paddled back out andum just there\\'s a lot behind it I feellike the people who do really good hereput so much time in and you can reallysee it shows um I have a lot of respectfor people who do good here and um itwas actually really bombear didn\\'t dosuper good cuz he\\'s amazing uh but yeahwatching um Harry Bryan on that last onelike that was that was crazy I\\'m reallyenjoying thisevent as we see UMakaskipping Into the Danger Zone on hislast wave and Finn had a wave before andnow he\\'s up again looking for these endCorners just to getbusy I mean they\\'re doing the best theycan to make the most out of of trulychallenging conditions as this wind hasonly gottenstronger in your uh campaigns in the inthe qualifying series you\\'re generallyspeaking in priority forers Heats andyour your mind is locked in to a certainsort of structure of of of of how to towork through that you find yourself in acompletely different situation here inno priority how awkward was it andwhat\\'s your takeaway of the experienceuh yeah I mean I don\\'t I I haven\\'t donea heat without priority since I wasprobably like 12 years old so it wasdefinitely trippy it felt like we\\'re atthe beginning of a heat the entire timecuz everyone\\'s trying to push each otherdeeper like put each other out ofposition and then when the wave cameyou\\'re like so focused on being in theright spot but then someone else couldbe just a little bit deeper so I was Iwas kind of struggling cuz I\\'m also likeI don\\'t know I\\'m notsuper like knowledged with this wave tooso like trying to find the right spotbut not be too deep or too wide justit\\'s another Factor so it was it wastough but I was I was stoked I washaving fun how would you say thisexperience sort of shapes your you knowyou you talked about like I had a reallybad wipe out here and that kind ofspooked me didn\\'t really want anythingto do with it then you saw the eventtaking place last year and you\\'re like Ithink I\\'d like to be a part of it nowthis experience how does it sort ofaffect your goals um for yourrelationship with pipeline um yeah I\\'mwishing I put in a lot more time thelast few years I just kind of rattledmyself I was like 15 and paddled out waslike 10 ft 22 seconds should have nevergone out um so I was always surfing OfftheWall G out I\\'m sorry when you describedit before I was like I was thinkingpicturing like a sixoday I should have never paddled out Idon\\'t know what I was thinking wellthat\\'s like the be that\\'s like thebeginning of a horror film where you\\'relike oh this is the person who\\'s goingto go first yeah no I think everyone waskind of expecting it and then I ended upon the beach and they\\'re like oh yepthere\\'s the little girl who paddled outthere well salute to you that was kindof like a win that you actually made itback to land on that day but you\\'d liketo keep like to keep pushing yourselfout here yeah um definitely I want totake a lot more time to be out here Ifeel like even though I was here for twoweeks before the event I still like knownothing about this wave and so I\\'mhoping for next year I\\'ll just give it alot more time and spend a lot more timethis yeartoo well it seems like you did a goodjob it seemed that you have a uh you\\'rea quick learner out there seen you getsome nice waves out during thiscompetition and it seems likeyou\\'re going to be all that much betterfor it next year when you\\'re coming outhopeso 19 minutes andchange AAP Pang isthe only person in this heat who needs asingle score uh that could change thingsfor Mikey February which he can do yeswhich he can do by anymeans if that wave comes to him talk alittle bit about M\\'s uh sort of Legacythat he comesfrom here atpipe I mean he if you look at just hisdad his dad is an amazing shaper boardBuilder uh for the Town and Countrylabel uh has shap boards for so manyLegends before and currently uh hedefinitely has the insightand you know he it\\'s not just his his inaddition to the Legacy he has a TightCrew Wana Jones Wong he has uh Baronmamia Noah bashin uh his tight group ofthe next generation of pipeline Surfersuh they and they\\'re the generation abovethem they look up to that\\'s Eli and anduh Nathan and Ivan you know thesethey\\'re right there in the mix CoRothman so they they have learning fromsome really talented pipelineSpecialists well doing this little lulllet\\'s check in with Holly who\\'s with acouple of Legends Go Happy Happy gollucky Noah Dean and Craig Anderson higuys yeah I\\'m here at the fat tie barhaving a little refresh drink with thelads uh neither of you made the top fourbut who\\'s you pick for the day uh who\\'sin the final topall

at the barAustralians just they can\\'t help but bemostly happy all the time yeah do younotice that in your travels yeah they\\'realways having the best times I feel likeit\\'s pretty cool to watch it\\'s a glasshalf full existence99.9% of thetime as we look in the Horizon thislooks likeanother I don\\'t know Gori is this are weon the are we are we on on the off yeah45 minutes on 45 minutes off I mean it\\'sit\\'s so clear now those those wind wavesare definedyeah and this is what\\'s going tointensify over the next week forecast itto intensify so those who will remain onthe NorthShore the visitors um they\\'reprobably going to be looking for somemore sheltered waves uh those who livehere will go to the waves that areshelter I hope that some of those thatlive here will perhaps lead me to jointhem in the Quest for shelter I\\'m justgoing to put that out there now thenjust searchin for for folks who who maybe haven\\'tbeen watching and and listening to yourdetailed explanation they might be goingbut I\\'ve been watching I was watchingearlier today and the waves weren\\'trunning off why are they closing up notlike this Dr Kono well I mean that onelooked pretty decent you have one partyou have the sand again still towardsthe end section here uh that could beshutting it down you also have the swellDirection starting to change you don\\'thave the more Westerly swell as it firststarted to come in this morning uh it\\'snow shifting more towards the north soagain you go from this really nice swellCorridor which allows for those pipelinelefts to come in and of now you have a abit more North Direction kind of runningoff the reef but it still has thosewests so now you have shutting down onboth back door and at pipe whichunfortunately is creating a bit of pickand chooseand need a little luck to find thatyourself in the right position as kirwas saying you know it\\'s not just youryourum your early entry into pipeline lineupbut also you see experienced people MakPang you know uh Finn who is as apipeline pro- Champion they\\'re findingdifficulty out there so again it\\'sdifficult conditions but it\\'s still uhagain coming down to what sets apartthose people who you see in the top fourum and apart from probably Mikey whothrew out the Good Vibes and came backwith a the right vibration to tap intothose back door waves uh John John Billyand Seth they are they hunt those wavesthey\\'re they move yeah on the reef yeahMikey\\'s I think his best wave was somuch farther down than like your normalback door wave too was like he he waskind of like in the right position forthat wave yeah he was paddling back outafter getting destroyed yeah uh gettingpounded by those off-the-wall backdoor I don\\'t know how much this affectsit but when you woke up this morning itwas literally flat and now it\\'s big doesthat kind of like make the waves not asgood or is that matter too much wellwhen you when the the sand was very muchfilled up in the reef and now you havetheSW Rising it\\'s it\\'s it\\'s pulling thatsand off the reef but again you usuallywant big westwells to pull the sand offof The Reef uh but this is a moreNorthwest North facing swell soit\\'s kind of just packing it in everyset a little bit goes back on the reef alittle bit gets taken offso definitely when it\\'s flat it the sandaffects the wave and that\\'s when you seethe that back wash I don\\'t know if youhad some back wash in your heat yeahyeah little bit there was like a weirdchop especially on the right though theleft actually we had we got pretty luckyit wasglassy we have some movement to chumbogoing for itoh that does not feel good man you justhope that they penetrate that\\'s thebiggest hope looks like he\\'s stillunder where ishe it\\'s crazy from the beach you justsee it he is you don\\'t see that muchpower and the other day I just bailed onone and I didn\\'t come up for so long Iwas starting to get a little worried andthen I could hear waves going over meand like board broke and thank God Icame up oh godwow nothing when you\\'re in thatsituation Kira what where do you go tosort of notpanic okay weird enough a long time agoI saw this bird sitting in the skycompletely still and it was there forlike an hour just completely still butit was like hunting something so it wasin like complete Focus and I just thinkof that bird and just complete Stillnessand it like helps me like control mybreathing I feel like so then when I\\'mholding my breath I\\'m just like notpanicking Bruno Santos pulling into ohthat one looked like it almost couldhave been makeable that\\'s amazing yeahso when you\\'re out there getting Ppounded and you\\'re feeling that leashcord stretch and you\\'re hearing waterrunning over you like the possibility ofanother wave going overhead perhapshaving a two-wave hold down you\\'re justfocusing on that bird that bird is my Idon\\'t know it\\'s my calmness I guessthat\\'s killer that\\'s I just learnedsomething that\\'s uh that\\'s hopefullythat you use that not just when you\\'regetting pounded by the waves I use itall the time before I reheat I\\'m likedoing breath work and I just think ofthat bird it\\'s like my spirit animal orsomething where did this take place inum Ventura there was just I don\\'t knowit was up in the hills we were surfingum kind of like actually I don\\'t evenknow where we were it\\'s like a beachbreak but this bird was just thereforever and we I couldn\\'t stop watchingit and I just your spirit animal me yeahyour spirit animal said hey KiraStillness like me yep will carry you farand it\\'ll it\\'ll just pop up in my head Idon\\'t even have to like think of it it\\'sjust like oh well it\\'s time to be calmwe\\'re we\\'re getting worked we might notcome back up I like to think when whenI\\'m getting pounded I think of a SophieBelle I would start laughing and andchoke water and die if I startedthinking of SophieBell jumbo that girl charges she\\'s yeahshe charge she charges and she has themost care for she\\'s like chicken Joe mhmlike she\\'s justcruising Bruno looking for that exit butgobbled by the white water that wouldhave been a cool one oh why I say Sophiejust when she was in here talking withus we were asking her do you wear awatch like I don\\'t I don\\'t know time Iknow reef sand I don\\'tknow my favorite line was I don\\'t have awatch but I ask people what time it isall thetime if you don\\'t like Sophie Bell itsays a lot a lot about you as a persontwo pipeline Warriors Benji Brown somesaying the best pipeline wave so far ofthe season and the Hawaiian Powerhousekaana APO run her uplast year runner up such an incredibleevent last year with colana coming fromjust really feeling he didn\\'t know if heshould have got in you know the drawswere it was the first invitation in along time people saying a lot of thingskanana just took that as fuel now makingthe dying moments the final fromliterally one of the last positionsshooting his way all the way to thefinals into second place col up thepeople\\'s champ people\\'s Champion bigparty in town after for him oh yeah itwas like he won huh is like he wonthat\\'s awesome shout out to Scottyfountain in town with the rest of thecrew at SummerStreet chumbo lookingagainlooks tough like not a lot ofopportunity and everyone\\'s kind ofscrambling it looks like you folks hadkind of a killer moment today forcompetition kind of oh no we we got thebest of it forsure when they showed replays of moana\\'sfinal waves I was like yeah yeah we wegot lucky yeah I mean it wasstreamy I mean critical but like thedream waves that were ridden by thewomen today completely stand out it keptit pretty on your toes because there wasa lot of high scoring waves coming whereis it seems in the men\\'s and these thesefinal Heats there\\'s tens and zeros likethere\\'s not a lot of high scoringpotential to do work yeah how long agowas Harry Bryant\\'s wave maybe an hourhour and a half hour and a half whichwas a after a low for a long low Sethyeah about a 45 minute lull beforeyou\\'re right before Seth man and theygot theirs back to back and the onlyother sort of real standout wave afterthat was was John John\\'s wave yeah whichwas yeah not as good asHarry\\'s Taro watab Taro watab styleKing who is on the rise if you haven\\'tseen his new edit should check itout is this become more common place asmoh M leaning in WoW driving let\\'s golet\\'s gohey that\\'s what we were talking aboutare we we see a you think we\\'re seeing ashuffle and the only person in this heatwho needs a single score it was M Pangoh looking for a 22.6 is that going tobe the score to take Mikey February outI I wouldn\\'t be with what\\'s being well Idon\\'t what\\'s being thrown out today we\\'seen some interesting things I don\\'tknow we\\'ll take a look at it again butthat was a that was a pretty criticalwave Mak and you could you could tell assoon as he stood up and turned into ithe was like yeah well this too we we\\'relike on the screen and it\\'s like sozoomed in you\\'re kind of like what it\\'shard to know because you don\\'t see thefull wave as you\\'re you know we\\'relooking at like this as he takes off onthe boil drops in sets the rail one pumpholds it knowing okay I\\'m out stoshestok oh man I mean there\\'s not manyopportunities right now I think this isgoing to go pretty wow yeah that thingheed so careful bro don\\'t jum head firsthe almost got like a Chip Shot off ofthe boil yeah on that takeoff he\\'sanother one that does these late dropstoll hangers and he\\'s just into itthat\\'s so comfortable this is like aroll in tohim and the way he negotiates that thatfirst rib that came up the face justlike pumped over it I I would I would besurprised if he doesn\\'t get that scorethat he needs well I mean that\\'s sevenand change right across the board sevenyeah seven and change across the boardI\\'m I\\'m thinking that he\\'s probablygoing to I\\'m going to say he\\'s going toget it not not going to Waffle Bruno Strying to look for a similarsituation uh running off I mean that wasand again if we we look at the thecriteria of wave selection also cominginto the factor and when it\\'s atliterally needle and the Hy stack stylepipeline I wonder how much of that willfactor in aswell yeah I feel like it\\'d be hard tojudge a day like this because it\\'s sodifferent from two hours ago that a wavelike that is just like so rare totallyit\\'s hard to get it chumbo oh goshhammering through trying to find hisrail ah again in thesoup he\\'s thinking about the bird rightnow you know the bird got him through ychumbo he he\\'s a machine he\\'ll do that20 times in a rowhe\\'s you know he\\'s so happy gol luckybut in the waterhe\\'sTerminator looks like he got it whatMaka has moved into second place wowgood job bro and so if the final was tohappen right now it would literally beall Hawaiian at the Vans pipe Mastersthe score for Mak Pang coming through at28.8 wow Three N in change yeahsee youknowit seems like the pipeline potential ishigher scoring than the back doorwhich not to say that it wasn\\'t thatgreat of a wave that was a a great waveyou know looking at that you know youcompare that to say Billy\\'s wave earlierum are they have to you know look backand think they cannotforget the scoringsystem 2 minuteswell we send our congratulations toMichael February for a incredibleperformance overall as he sits now inthat fifthspot and he was in that in a heat thatwas wave starved and wasn\\'t able to makea difference right on that boil rightgetting Barrel over those cracks thatwe\\'re talking about over the reef andblown out right into that channellook atthis I mean that was a lot to negotiatestok and how that instant fire allheart such an amaz you know kaana andBenji are frothing right now they\\'relike yes those are the waves we like youknow Benji\\'s like maybe I go a littlebit deeper you know maybe colana is likemaybe I stall you know now they\\'relooking at each other how do we improveon what exists if we get the wavebecause it\\'s hard to now beat that WaveIt\\'s hard to find one of those waves andhow are you going to beat the score umwhen you have something that\\'s executedsoperfectly does uh Benji or colana haveany good waves already or or Benji hasone right Benji has one yeah cuz I feellike if you have at least one or two beeasier but it\\'s so tough out there rightnow to two would be way if you have twobetter than way way better yeah yeah asuh Maka just he won the lotterybasically he\\'s so stoked now

in this boothcommentating especially on days likethese Imean waves coming from the right wavescoming from the left waves coming fromstraight waves not even coming waves notcoming got at all today look at thatcurrent ripping through theinside yeah it\\'s uh it\\'s a special placepipeline you think you can just paddlestraight out next thing you know you\\'redown my Rocky Pointmhm there\\'s a reason people paddle downthe beach to paddle out to this wave isthere is acurrent that\\'s trying to find its wayback out to the lineup and you have toride that current around the edge andhopefully shoot the Gap if not you\\'llprobably be making the Walk of Shame Iwas just going to say there\\'s nothingworse than paddling out getting caughtin that current and then just horribletiming where you end up in between pipeand gums just getting pounded I don\\'tthink there\\'s ever been a surfer thathasn\\'t missed time Pipeline and then yougot to come in and walk up the beachhead down some guys just keep paddlinguntil they finally get out it\\'s almostbetter to just paddle way down and comearound and actually have to walk back upto beach nobody wants to do that nobodywants to look anybody in the eye if theygotdenied deniedoh who is thattaita just a quick pocket ride up anddown your Surfer inblue wow look how bumpy it is justtrying to slow down alot is that Benji wow look at that bumpytakeoff oh how much I can\\'t believe hestayed on his feet how much points doeshe get for that look at thebackwash it\\'s crazy out there it\\'s it\\'sdefinitely not perfect pipeline it isdefinitely whoever wins today is goingto have their work have had their workcut out for them especially surfing thisevening you\\'re going to have to pick andchoose I mean here we might have ourfirst cleanup set to wash guys wash guysthrough the lineup that\\'ll be prettycool show you guys what it looks like toget mowed down onTV and here itcomes let\\'s see if anybody\\'s too deepand gets caught Inside byit two surface outback I think our other two surface hadcotton waves so they\\'re safe in thechannel was one ofthem you\\'re going have to be reallyselective mhm that one that one was goodtill it wasn\\'t that was not that one wasgood till it wasn\\'t by any chance it wasnot a goodwave there aren\\'t very many good wavesout there MAA f diamond in the roughlike a real diamond in therough and 4 minutesleft not

and gentlemen here in heatN9 the second to the last Heat of theround before the final and the lastchance for these fourSurfers to try and do what isneeded to be able to get into one ofthose coveted four spots that are up forgrabs anybody\\'sgame and here we go with a rip goingright through the middle ofpipeline being a pipeline surfing andbeing in the lineup and seeing the ripcome through the lineup is got to be oneof the most irritating things can everhappen to you mhm you\\'re sitting thereat 3 minutes you need a score and it\\'sabsolutely ripped out Imean nothing you can do maybe that\\'swhere they got the term ripped out fromsomething that\\'s like real bad vibes andsucks someone that\\'s rippedoutme with 2 minutes and 43 seconds hereyou got to be thinking Benji and Taroare like I need awave please please please 2 minutes and30 seconds away from either jumping inone spot closer to 100,000or one step closer dumping into thedonationpot you has donated your time and yourefforts but sorry sir not today allright so if the 4 Hawaiians that are inthe top spots right now do end up in thefinals I guess you got one kanaka andthree Hawaiians mhm just those four whodo you got your money on to win thewhole thing uh right now I\\'m going to gosetmon I\\'m going to go John John he\\'salways a safe bet yep but got to go thepeople on thisone our one Hawaiian blooded surfer inthe final so far set Mon and we backingset mon100% right now in thisevent Billy keer always a threat evenwith a brokenfoot Billy keer is right there59.60 he\\'s in the mix he\\'s no strangerto competition and winning events sowe\\'ll see what Billy cando had that amazing wave in his lastHeat M Pang is just he\\'s always keepingit real that\\'s one of the BRS that youknow what I mean you can always knowwhat you\\'re going to get when you seeMaka coolest BR such a warrior out hereat pipeline all right one minuteremaining in thisheat second to last here of theday Surfers needing somescores hope isfadingit\\'s like when the light at the end ofthe tunnel starts fading starts gettingdarker and darker and the piano and theviolin startplaying they\\'re going to ask you do youwant some cheese with that wine when youget to the beach I\\'m sure there\\'s somewhining going on out here today oh Ishould have done this should have couldhave would have but you never you had achance and the only ones that have achance coming up in the next seat as yousee sitting there in the Channel withKal Grace bam stockRussell bery and Shawnmanners what do you think Russell beryand Shawn manners are thinking right nowafter seeing their mate brought HarryBryant get thatwave I think they\\'rethinking if he can do it it\\'s it\\'s outthere it\\'s possible those wavesexist although I don\\'tknow that Harry brand wave was kind of aunicorn I mean yeah that wassometimes it\\'s better to be lucky thanbe good and uh the lucky you are thebetter you get sometimes and uh out hereat pipeline luck is always your bestfriend yes New York New York New Yorkwhat\\'s up your boy Ballam stockspaddling out bam stack call Grace RHawai in from the northan manners waAustralia and Russell berky from Allahdala newWales one American two Australians andone Hawaiian in this heat so there wasno shakeups to the leaderboard in thatlastHeat but we got one more heat to gothings could change what do these guysactually need it\\' be pretty cool to seethe actual numbers in real time exactlywhat they need because I don\\'t thinkanybody really has one high score Ipretty pretty sure they both need two Ithink they all need a combinationexcellent scoresyes it\\'s hard enough to get one waveright now in these conditions especiallyright now that\\'s going to betough but you never know makua how manytimes you been out here at this hour inthe afternoon and pipes looking messylike this and then all of a sudden thewind changes something like somethingsome little thing just Chang changes andall of a sudden it just turnson I really hope that it does thatbecause from all the years that I havesat here and watched this wave once itturns like this it doesn\\'t stop thisNorth Direction with this northeast windis usually not something that backs offImean I\\'m only human I make mistakes Icould be wrongbut from my experiences out here I thinkthese conditions will stickaroundthere you see on your screen Russellbery with the highest score single wavescore out of any Surfer in this heatnonetheless he will also need twoexcellent wave scores to crack into thattopfour walking up the beach[Music]kif I\\'m not mistaken one of Eva Beach\\'sfinest everybody out there in Campbelltown how Bush boys where you guysat everybody about a Chase sure you guysare watching call rightnowala and we had apaddle but nogoal look like a little Tepe here in thebackground on this one could be it\\'llsplit the peak what do you know let\\'ssee oh it\\'s call Grace nice here we goleft oh spin was going left wow get inthereRuss dang just a little too far in frontof it but oh Kal should have went forthatone a little too far in front of it butman my hat\\'s off for that whip that whiparound I mean if you\\'re going to let awave that perfect go by I mean someone\\'sgoing to catch it especially right nowand uh had Russell been able to stall alittle bit more or take off deeper wherekala was that would have been excellentexcellent up in that 28 to 30 range Ibelieve nonetheless it was still abeautiful ride I mean as critical as itgets out here at pipeline just not thedeepest Barrel compared to what we\\'vebeen seeing getting a really high scorestoday walk us through thisreplayI mean such a critical drop but yeah hejust needs to be a little deeper you yousee that whitewash that was behind himyou would have caught that crumble fromthewhitewash right back there could havebeen in the barrel but I mean what elsemore could he really have done I mean nofrom the position he was in he he surfedthat excellent excellently also berkysurfed this W excellent turning aroundwhipping grabbing Dragon pulling underthat was a pretty close to perfectlyexecuted ride by Russell berky on thatone 22 minutes remain in the final heatof round threethis is the last Heat last chance forSurfers to crackinto those last four spotskiing so Maka how hard maybe explain forthe viewers how hard is it to make thatlast minute decision and just whiparound and almost like no paddletakeoff drop on the wave like that on awave likepipeline that decision is a big onesometimes you know but uh and it\\'s ait\\'s a split second decision well thatdecision it\\'s not hard to make thedecision it\\'s hard to follow throughwith the decision it\\'s hard to executeit\\'s hard to execute the whip you whiparound anybody can whip around and makelike they\\'re going but to actually goand pull into thatBarrel to find out more you\\'re going tohave to come back we have a specialguest coming up for you

everyone likeand you kind of seen it looks like and Imean look atthat does that ever get old gettingcarried up that beach no I I\\'m I justwant to relive that moment again andagain I\\'m have I

look at your t-shirt that you\\'rewearing how much how much of that manright there is inspirational to you andand what you\\'ve done so far here atpipel so that\\'s something I want to talkabout

shows in your surfing every timeyou peddle out so oh thank you K I wantto know what your biggest um confidencebooster is out there knowing that peopleare going down knowing that this wave isso powerful and and and dangeroussometimes what what gives you thebiggest motivation or the confidence toget out out there and do it time andtime again even though not every timeyou make it I don\\'t know honestly likewhen I go out there I actually feel likeI have zero confidence I actually feellike I\\'m going to get smoked every timeI paddle out until I paddle for a waveor actually until I see my wave comingfor me and then all of a sudden like Ijust my brain just turns off and I gointo like this like this state where Idon\\'t even think and she just smilesyeah I guess I just smileso I I\\'m curious so tell me you know atthe start of the day you were not inthat fourth place spot you had toscratch your way into that spot in yourheat um how does it feel to not even bein contention and then

I mean congratulations to Johnhe\\'s got his owncompany he\\'s got a great team behind himhis beautiful wifeLauren so Moana package who else wereyou impressed with on the women\\'s sidein this event I Aaron Brooks reallySteed it up she did she was sending ityes she was and Molly was going offMolly was on fire I haven\\'t seenbackhand Barrel riding by woman out atpipe like that since forelle Ballardyeah yeah I think right now Molly islike the best backside Barrel rider inthe world for women yeah she definitelywasn\\'t letting up she was right on yourheels oh yeah she was right on my heelsand I I knew that and it was funny afterI caught my second wave she\\'s like whatdo you think that was you think that wasbetter than your first and I\\'m like whatare you trying to see how much youneed you know that\\'s what she was doingwhat about the positioning there you\\'relike you\\'re like sorry girl I put thenail in the cin yeah but check this outevery time you guys went back to thelineup it was you outside Molly rightbehind you and then there would beCarissa more on the inside and itstarted off like that the middle of theheat it was like that and at the end ofthe heat was like that so I waswondering they must have they must haveknown that someone knew the reef prettygood out here and uh maybe they thoughtthey could pick a few straps off if thequeen allowed and she only allowed onescore to slip by and then she was likeoff with their heads and I\\'m off to theraces $100,000 later a second pipelineMaster\\'s title couldn\\'t have happened toa better person I\\'m very blessed verythankful well this heat has not beenthat blesseduh it\\'s 8 minutes left and uh it\\'s beenpretty lackluster to say the leastuh Uncle Ray over there oh bamBallam nicepoof so I guess are the only people thatare confirmed in the final right now isJohn John Florence and MCC ping I don\\'tthink anybody\\'s confirmed because ifguys get three waves they can still getit but I mean as of now it\\'s pretty muchthey\\'re look they\\'re feeling prettyconfident pretty much three guys yeahyou never want to be well you know youwere you were sitting on the fourthbubble was on the bubble but I mean nowlook baller I\\'m guaranteed better that12 so he\\'s going to need another score 7minutes left Russell berky can get a 22no problem ball around stat can get anyscore out here no problem so I don\\'tthink anybody\\'s really safe yet yeahit\\'s justuh look how bumpy that wave was you seehis board justlike the chops get under his board thatboard doesn\\'t look like it works as goodas the Kim board he wasriding it\\'s kind of squirly yeah itlooked a little squirly did yeah yeahlook at that spit look even on thatbottom turn turn it\\'s just kind of uh uhuh I mean ball surf so good you can tellwhen hisequipment\\'s well I think the bump on theface has a lot to do with it too yeahbut I mean cuz it looks bumpy you seensome of those drops he was taking lastyear that was pretty roll inish and uhhis board was sticking to the face LikeGlue last year look at that big spitfact I was actually riding the sameboards is ball on today oh yeah y samemodel must not be the arrow must be theshooter because you made your boardslook like butter oh yes look almost likelike you could ride a door you rip thevcam door off and go out there and inthe contestalready amazing ballaround I guess it\\'s not the bow or thearrow kala Grace is just chomping at thebit I think he made a mistake early onletting that wave go and letting uh hemight have been a little too far behindit you know how you get behind the waveat Pipeline and you just can\\'t pushyourself over the leg I just didn\\'tthink it looked like it was going tothrow grow that good you know what Imean it\\'s pretty deceiving with thenorth Northerly Direction but then it\\'llhit a a double up and act you know fireacross that inside so you really got tobe selective I think today you mighthave to take some chances it\\'sespecially with 5 minutes to go youbetter be taking some chances let\\'s callout Grace oh that one was no goodoh I think the wind is causing it tokind of be chandeler out there right nowit is your your final like your stokethe women went first and then the menand your final landed in the hour thatit did because uh I know the conditionswere just waves are absolutely perfectfor your is this the first time inhistory

Pang inheat seven excuse me heat eight uh tojump his wayup Billy keer also making that jumptoday Seth mon I mean John John Florenceis the only one who\\'s left from Heat 2that was in that top four as theHawaiians made a hard charge to get usinto that final of course you were allaware of the incredible performanceby the newQueen reigning champ Moana Jones Wangand no doubt theseHawaiians deeply inspired by herperformance uh and to be able to havethis all Hawaiian finalHawaiianresidents and the native hawaian MH herein the finalmhm it\\'s always an interesting represpresentation here when we ask I\\'m surethere\\'s a lot of kanaka Hawai out therewondering when we sayHawaiians there\\'s a a question what doesthat mean to be Haw does it mean youlive in Hawaii or does it mean you haveHaw ancestry and I think this is stillyet to be discussed within the surfingCommunity because we have people likeJohn John Florence who is without uhNative ha ancestry but is born andraised here in the islands uh whereasSeth MO is born and raised as well withkanaki ancestry the Koko as wesay um not too you know I think when werecognize there\\'s differences then we\\'reable to marginalize those differencesbut to not recognize that there is infact a difference here in the islandswhen when I would be surprised if Iheard John say he\\'s haai but I I verymuch appreciate when he says herepresents Hawaii Hawaii yes well Hawaiivery very well strongly represented inthis final and thank you for forpointing out those particulars tobecause to ignore uh The Roots cultureuh which is which flows through this uhthis population and through the throughthese islands uh would be a Miss 40minutes in this finaluh we are back in prioritymode priority top two scores determinthewinner scores from the first threerounds are no longer relevant it\\'s awhole new game we are in the finals thecrowds are going crazy on the beachright now people are freaking out I haveto say you know Roy Russell described itso so accurately the many faces and thethe the es and flows uh of Pipeline andwe saw just before those this last Heatyou know it seemed like oh is this isthis going to beit Russellbery good good showing that he\\'samazing people are looking you knowright now the swell is flexing on thereef there are challenging conditionsbut insane waves to be ridden out hereeveryone\\'s going to be tested these areall pipe Specialists out here balaramstack was the defending champion fromNew York last year one of the thingsthat balaram is known for over the yearsis being one of those you know you\\'relooking at messy messy Pipeline andyou\\'re just like wondering what\\'s goingon and then you\\'re like is that a humanbeing out there and balaram would be oneof those people almost by usually byhimself yeah which amongst these fourSurfers uh are the ones that you wouldyou would see on on S of one of thoseunruly days where the opportunities areSlim but there\\'s you could get a richreward you know every I would say everysingle one of theseSurfers if pipe hasn\\'t been breaking ina while and it\\'s breaking every one ofthem would be out even if it\\'s unrulyand messy all four of these people havea special deep connection to pipelinethat they would be out even if it\\'s bigand messy who\\'s out there the most oftenprobably makana cuz he\\'s the youngestyou know of the crew he\\'s he\\'s in thethe standing of where everyone sits outthere um yeah everyone wants perfectpipe for sure but I\\'ve seen John outwhen it\\'s not that good and he somehowcan find the good ones and again whenit\\'s big and messy and weird and crazythere\\'s always those Diamonds in theRough the gems and these any one ofthese guys know how to get it we\\'ll getin more into more of the particulars ofthese four and I\\'m going to put you onthe hot spot to make a pick the firstwill\\'ll check in with the defendingchamp balaram stack who is withHolan balaram uh obviously last year\\'s PMaster who\\'s you picked for thisfinal um M of pay all day I would loveto see that dude go take it outespecially with the field he\\'s got withhim right now I\\'ll be stoked yeah andhow was it out there the conditions areobviously big and gnarly oh man it wasbig it was gnarly it was everything youcan fit into those two words and like Idon\\'t know it was fun giving it a try itwas like either you\\'re not catching awave or you\\'re going over the falls oryou might get a good one and like kindof got a little in between of all thatso I don\\'t know it was fun I had a greattime trying and I mean I heardbefore I went out my my brother\\'s GRS Igot two nieces and a nephew Coensaraphina and and Kane and uh that waslike the motivation to get going likefinally last Heat like I was like yesthey\\'re watching yeah but um no I\\'mstoked everybody back home that waswatching I\\'m like forever in Deb toeverybody so I\\'m feels good to be herenow and feels good to be on the beach sooh no I\\'m here now thank you guys thoughit\\'s great time cheers thanks for comingenjoy a fewdrinks bam a humble past Champion yougreat job I love about bam you know wetalk about it all the time the way he isas you see some big big set marching inright now these guys are about to getcleansed there\\'s a cleansing takingplace in thisfinal there\\'s some perspective on thecleansing oh wow the swell is in cleansemode just breaking out the back nowfully realizing itself you see thosevideos of of John John uh doing thoseduck Dives where he goes underwater allthe way across a pooland uh you wonder if he\\'s able to applysome of that right now as all fourSurfers getting flexed on but back tobalaramstack he\\'s walked with such ahumility in his years since he was a kidcoming to the NorthShore earning hisspot in the vam house where you watchhim walk around uh in this community andhe is respected as if he is one of thecommunity yeah he\\'s the he\\'s thehonorary Hawaii resident here I think uhspending time and also again those bigand messy days he\\'s out there by himselfwhen the people are out surfing pahiJaws WEA outside different places he\\'sout here at pipe waiting for it to justget small enough where it\\'s not justwashing through like what we\\'re seeinghereum oh the question is is it better toduck dive or do you bail on the secondI didn\\'t see I didn\\'t seeanyone bail theirboard I I think I seen MAA bail M bailor someone did you knowsometimes what do you what do you do Ibail I bail and I ride the white waterin I I take it all the way to the shoreand I runaway I\\'m a clutch I\\'m aclutcher I\\'m a clutcher my surfboard inthose situations becomes a uh a teddybear SL security blanket I had one atcloudbreak once you know you\\'re you\\'reout there and it\\'s like 6t and all of asudden 10 Footers start marching throughand you\\'re in the wrong spot and you\\'relike okay well one thing we\\'re going tonot do is we\\'re not going to expire yeahand I like to clutch I but sometimes youtry to clutch it it just get rips out ofyour ripped out of your arms anyway I\\'vehad it duck diving and I\\'ve had um myteeth you know get my lip get cut and myface gets slammed by the board brokenboard so to me taking the humility roundtrip also uh it seems to me a betteroption either I break my leash or youknow I I get washed in but I\\'ve learnedpersonally for me when I duck dive onbig sets um there\\'s more actionhappening the board might come hit hitme so I\\'m yeah I\\'m definitely more of aa thrower who\\'s this John weirdyJohn how do you get how do you get doneduck diving all those waves and thendecide to try and go on something likethat that\\'s he knows it\\'s is like thisis his thing he\\'s he\\'s here for a reasonno stranger to winning and now he\\'sapplying it and when you\\'re number onein a lot of people\\'s minds and act inreality of standings or rankings there\\'sa lot torepresent can\\'t just be like I meanthere\\'s a bit of self self- pressure I\\'msure that he has for himself to want toperform at the highest level and thatcomes down in his mind okay whileeveryone\\'s catching their breath myadvantage could be to turn around andget a wave and just establish the TheNarrative again maybe he\\'s not inpriority right now I don\\'t know what thepriority is going on righthere cuz priority is a thing in thefinals here top two waves count towardsyour final score so with the conditionslike like they are right now especiallywith all this sand how do those biggiant sets sort of will they affect thelineup in realtime I I think for deep water wavestaller waves bigger waves uh a lot ofsurfers like to look for a smoother faceit can smooth out the water for a asmoother face not as much bumps becauseon bigger waves you have bigger chopsand it\\'s a lot bigger risk to hit thosechops at pipeline you see that alsostarts to floodthe water onto the reef causing a bit ofbatet so it\\'s not set in stone that okaylet the first one go and the secondone\\'s going to be smoother there mightbe too much water now from the previouswave coming in and now you don\\'t havethat same amount of draw off the reef itcould affect negatively what the facelooks like yeah we saw like during oneof those really big sets in the lastHeat in that heat 10 like 3ft sidewaysrunning from south to North Across TheReef all right your current leader JohnJohn Florence with a one a one and aone we\\'re going to see that change I\\'msure a one and a one and a one that hethat was felt though oh yeahhe we\\'re hearing some noise out theresomething\\'s happening and people justfreakingout I think people are just fired upthat we\\'re in thefinalGreat Performances todayfrom you know John Florence to just puthimself Out Of Reach basically from aHunger Game perspective of of beingtaken out but Brothers M Pang Billy keerSeth mon all came in to the day knowingthat they needed awave and they they got they they settheir intention and they were able toaccomplish thatI mean it\\'s you know everyone on theNorthShore whether they competed theyare no longer in the finals in therunning to the people who haven\\'t got inthe contest who we know as part of thiscompetition deserve a spot to be herethe the Shaden picaros and the AAStewarts that are out there who put timeand time again um the Sheldon pons thatare you know working their way to showthey deserve a spot they\\'re watchingthis too and they\\'re stoked they\\'reeveryone is rooting for someone you gotmultiple Generations here that arerepresented in this lineup in this finalfrom John to Maka Billy and Seth peoplefrom Town Country you got outer Islandwe got people who are from the youngfresh crop it\\'s it\\'s a killerrepresentation to see who you rootingfor everyone in the NorthShore isprobably tuning in listening and that\\'sexciting exciting to see at least acommunity isnow represented in a a reallyinteresting way it\\'s not complete but atleast everyone is at least one degree ofseparation between everyone here in thefinals well well said and one of thethings I reallyappreciate in getting to commentate withyou is your ability to really put intocontext the the working parts of whatculture looks like here in the islandsit\\'s so easy to have a a a skewed pointof view from the outside looking in notreally understanding uh the culture andso I just appreciate all the differentmanners in which you\\'re able to explainand and learn learn people if you willon on what it means and also so thatpeople can can when they come to theislands it strengthens their ability toshow the proper type of respect uh whenvisiting this incredible placewell we we appreciate this opportunityto have a celebration in this uhmakahiki season that we\\'re in the timeofcelebrating agriculture fertility uhpeace but it\\'s also a time to uhshowcasesportsmanship M Pang dropping intosomething that didn\\'t quitematerialize uh in the Hawaiian culturetraditionally we have uh a 9monsemi 9month period of War season uhwhere the the chief Dums battle forum for Mana we call and that that worduh if those Surfers out there we talkabout this Mana Loosely translated thespiritual power uh but this Mana is thiskind of intangible thing that exists uhnot just in humans but in the waves inThe Reef in the wind in the rocks rocksand the trees it\\'s something that istransferable and it\\'s a feeling andthat\\'s something that maybe peopledescribe when they come to these islandsthey feel this mana and this war timethese 9 months out of the year you\\'retrying to elevate your ability toacquire the most amount of Mana uhthrough uh war is one aspect that isallowed but in these 3 months ofmakahiki season which we\\'re incurrently it\\'s abouta different way to acquire Manasportsmanship a celebrating your valueum and these makahiki games were putforward where people would showcasetheir efforts and this is one expressiona modern day expression of that so we\\'revery fortunate tohave this opportunity Oh Billy keerremember Billy competing with thatbroken fifth metatarsel in his left footso every time he takes off on a wave hewants to he\\'s doing the best he can tonot make thingsworse he justgets greeted if you will by thatwave where it\\'s going to be no one\\'sgetting handed this final today whoeverwins thisis working forit as more sets out the bat comein see the hawaian water Patrol justcoming in to make sure that Billy\\'s okayhaving a check on him as he is doing thehard yards rightnow H water Patrol a big Mahala to youfolks for keeping the competitorsafeand the Lifeguard norshore lifeguardAssociationCity and County PublicService the this wouldn\\'t be possiblewithout you folks keeping e Wong safe uhemo zurac uh we had some spills heretoday and it\\'s it\\'s amazing to see thatwe have infrastructure here to supportsafety and also uh courses such as thebig wave risk assessment group The bragcommunity who is out there who Eli Alonagain who\\'s been in many of theserescues has been he he first learned howto do rescue from the big wave risk thebigwave risk assessment group brag so thankyou for for the community giving thatinformation also to thecommunity and I love that you bring thatup as poor Billyjust doing doing the T yeah you see himwave away the ski though he said heyI\\'ll paddle out I made that choiceI\\'ll that\\'s a billy esque and after hegets this through this one he should getpulled through the rip and not have toduck dive uh again but I love how youbring up uh that big wave riskassessment because for many years it wassort of loose like outside of thelifeguarding Community amongst big waveSurfers there wasn\\'t necessarily a plantand afteryou know different incidents uh andinjuries Etc the Surfers coming togetherand being like okay we need to to toraise our Collective awareness of of oneanother each other as a collective inthese situations as we see MPang oh getting clipped um and it\\'s beengreat to watch the way that has evolvednot just from the life- savingperspective but also in the work for allof these Surfers to to learn the breathwork do the underwater work uh whathappens in bad situations to to to equipmake sure that everyone is as fullyequipped as possible for this level ofSurfing the strategies aredefinitely not very clear out hereduring thisheat we have people waiting but we alsohave people so far uh seems like Sethdidn\\'ttry to grab something he\\'s waitingtrying to be patient trying to pullfrom his hisfamily\\'sexperience son of legendarySurfer Uncle Tony monise seen lots ofshots of uh Tony mon on the beach allsmiles what a legend such a kind humanwhole family kind human but you knowUncle Tony he he had a work to get towhere he he is to be that Legend statushe\\'s I always was pretty nervous aroundUncle Tony oh first time I met him Icouldn\\'t even look him in the eye I wasjust like oh you\\'re you\\'re you\\'re notjust in the movies yeah right I mean hehe had these pogs with he it was if yougot the Uncle Tony POG like I rememberhaving them and they were like gold tome I don\\'t know I\\'m I\\'m I\\'m sure theyounger generation doesn\\'t know whatpogs are but like bottle caps it\\'s likeagame here\\'s the the road to how our fourfinalists made it in and uh on dayone John John Florence was doing JohnJohn Florence things at pipeline wow itlook how perfect thatlooks can\\'t believe that was the firstday but also Maka paying today doingwhat he had to do to get the final verysimilar to how kanana did last year inthe dire Heats of the day just stayingtrue holding his line and finding thosewaves gifted to him love that GoProperspective this was Billy keer caughtone wave in his first heat and he madeitcount yeah this was a awide tube that he just open up sayingyeah I have a broken foot opting to ridethe 68 instead of his normal 64 66 andSeth just doing the work getting reallyunderl riding a little bit longer boardbut navigating out through these barrelsthat wave wasinsane I mean that\\'s that\\'s what getsyou to the finals here being able tonavigate and for those who didn\\'t watchthe entire contest and are just tuningin for the finals it was not easy uh wehad Heats during the rounds where therewas essentially zero waves the scoringpotential was non-existent like similarto this heat now we we\\'re looking atthrees ones across the board Billy has aa combined score of half a point Makpang\\'s wave that we we saw that was theonly wave of its kind that came in hisheat and he sees the opportunitywholly I mean this is going to be hectictowards but again these are these areall you have world champions in thisseat you have uh an insanely talentedpipeline specialist from Mak ping andyou have Seth mon who if we think backto that heat he had with KellySlater he he went toe-to-toe with a amulti- world champion multi-pipelineMaster Triple Crown winner and you knowSeth held his own in in a waythat he he held himself self in such ahigh regard and respect that you know itit couldn\\'t go to a more deservingindividual right now if he were tomanifest a a wave outhere now that we\\'re back in thisprioritysituation the stakes are the highestthat they\\'ve been the entire event weare we have the the the title The thatLegacy that lasts with you forever ofbeing a pipe Master $100,000 for firstprize um do Seth and John John you thinkhave more of an advantage when it comesto playing the strategy of priorityespecially in theseconditions mean I I would say they\\'recurrently most they\\'re implementing thatstrategy on a more current basis rightnow by being a world championship tourSurfers uh Seth here taking off H notseeing good scoring potential on thatopting to bail out theback but again I\\'m not Idon\\'t I mean it\\'s obviously has to havesome sort of Advantage at a certainpointMakaoh kind of just roll the dice I guess Idon\\'t know likewhat I don\\'t know hard to tell what\\'sgoing on in the minds of theseindividuals right now none of themseeming to opt in to themic for their finalHeatI mean 16 minutes may seem like a longtime for us but I think this is going tofly by to these competitors we\\'rethere\\'s only 16 minutes left in a finaland this is this is a 40-minute final a40 minute final we are 2/3 of the weightfinished withthis with no major scores on theboard What would you be doing if youwere out there Salma what would I bedoing that\\'s hilarious if I was outthere if it was half the size it wasright nowum I don\\'t know I mean oh there\\'s somesets probably coming out the we can hearthebeach what would they be doing firstpriority is red second priority thisgeneration third priority blackpriority they\\'re about to fire up theBarbie who who you think those guys arerootingfor MAA I mean they\\'re that\\'s that\\'s theclosest to their age group I\\'m surethey\\'re like oh maybe uncle John Johnmight bringing home Uncle Billy throwyourself in this heat right now with 14minutes to go and everything that wediscussed on the line what are youlookingfor I I can\\'t even imagine even beingout there amongst these these Surfersbut if I was to in some alternateuniverse in space to be alongside ofthese amazing talented humans I probablywould be just sitting out the backwaiting for one wave something similarto getting an opportunity like whatHarry got or what bam got or you knowjust essentially what kais got you knowat this point um I I just Russell beybeylike at at a certain point these allthese all these guys want to win I\\'msure um like getting a sing we\\'regetting a good wave up P but four peopleout that could make your know make yourlife really I am wondering where ourprioritysituation is rightnow I know Seth is probably in the backof the pack I\\'m sure our production teamwill let us know I believe Seth was thelast person to go on awave you can really see that wind swellnow coming from the Northeast those ribsthat\\'s the that\\'s a surfaceswell getting a bit of surface currentpushing people down towards off the wallthat if you see they\\'re continuouslypaddling and it\\'s also pushing them inwhich youve seen a lot of surfers aregetting caught throughout the day it\\'sthey sit they think they\\'re in the spotand this wind just kind of keeps pushingthem into the Impact Zone you\\'re alwaysgot to think ahead and I\\'m sure that\\'sgoing through the minds of these theseSurfers okay how do I stay but all theseSurfers are from the generation ofsitting underneath the double up rightthe these aren\\'t Rollin Specialists thatare also amazing incredible Surfers outat pipeline this is the crop of situnderneath it so they don\\'t want topaddle too far out and they might beriding shorter boards to make sure theyJohnFlorence going around it reading it Imeanthere go he\\'s that guy he is that guydid you see how he made sure once he sawthat first section wasn\\'t going to offerhe\\'s like all right I\\'m going to goaround this thing and maximize whateverpoints I can get yeah I mean he if youlook he didn\\'t just pull off off thetakeoff into some crumbler he looked atit went around it waited to find thatBarrel again that\\'s just experienceknowing okay at this time I got to getbusy I got to do something what if a setdoesn\\'t come is it enough to win I don\\'tthink I don\\'t know probably not Sethuh now here\\'s a weird thing that I\\'mgoing to say it might be enough to wingiven given these conditions this allcomes on of that 45 on 45 off you knowwhat and if you you wonder now if hemight sit just a little bit more to thenorth and try to get some weird wide onethat comes underneath to Chuck in air doa couple ofturns and stay away from thepack oh and just like that oh John goingback doorher wow Imean this is just he he knows what he\\'sgot to do you know he\\'s I laugh becausepeople forget like howtenacious of a comp like Fiercecompetitor John John is because he doesdoesn\\'t wear it in his face he\\'s notvocal with it but he\\'s so so focused aswe saw him be like all right you guyspaddle back out I\\'m going to sit on theinside and back this thing up Mak paygoing in let\\'s go driving driving ohfalling smoked at theend you can almost see maybe the yearsof experience in here you have Maka I\\'mgoing to go I\\'m going to catch all he heis the most waves caught so far um whichalso gives him the most potential to geta high score and then you have Johnrecognizing let me just put something onthe board this this format is what JNdoes for a living to win World titlesyeah and when when that\\'s what you dofor a living like you saw it he just andyou\\'re also the best in the world you dothis taking the lead with a12.5for his lastwave you know when you when you see thewaves that are coming in but you knowokay these smaller back door waves justget deep and getout he\\'sstoked Maka looking for better qualitywaves but a little bitimperfection ah I don\\'t know whathappened there at that very end let\\'stake alook oh the see the foam ball justgobbled up hisboard waiting on the scores forMaka as JN paddles back out I think nowhe\\'s thinking okay now maybe wait for agood a good wave you know just strategywhere he can be patient wait forsomething big andweird knowing that he\\'s put pressure onon the rest of the field to get twowaves yeah remember for the last threedays three rounds excuse me it\\'s beenyou know I can get a wave here a wavethere now we\\'re back to like you got tostack thesetwo you know but you can\\'t count outanybody in this moment a single wave asingle mediocre wave will Propel any oneof these competitors into the topSE into the mix but now John is atcombined 30 we\\'re looking at 18 and a12 eight minutes to go ifyou\\'re if your yourBilly Sethor or Maka you you need to get one underyour belt a decent one under your beltand I think John just put the pressureon them saying you guys now need inreality one amazing wave in theexcellent range or two good wavesthat isn\\'t just like oh maybe I\\'ll catchtwo small ones like I\\'m sure there\\'s aprocess that John goes home with alittle notebook and paper and writesdown okay say this scenario happens orat least might talk through it with oneof his coaches to say okay what is thestrategy in this event this scenariohappens what should I do and you know nodoubt these drilled this a thousandtimes he had this heat already before ithappened you know this is just onevariation potentially and this is allspeculating cuz I don\\'t really know howfreakish he is in all this stuff but Icould imagine and I wouldn\\'t besurprised because you kind of people whoare successful in their life they dothis in whatever profession or path theychoose they have multiple scenarios thatthey have planned out and they wait foreach oneto present itself and then they executeMak M he\\'s just going big on these closeouts he\\'s trying to securesomething well you said it before you\\'llsee the difference inenergy from that sort of measuredcalculated to M just being like I\\'mgoing to throw myself over as many ofthese things as possible and I\\'m goingto I\\'m going to get thatwave you know the you can feel the T thetension pull inas why is Billy and Seth their game planmust be we\\'re waiting for good ones soyou if that situation happens again wedon\\'t have the priority in front of usso we don\\'t really know how thisstrategy is really playingout you see when the that\\'s spray comingoff the lip you able to see that thatwind in real time yeah that\\'s the windthat\\'s moving now more from the norththan from the East the the pristineconditions out here at this coast alongthe NorthShore are south east Southeastwinds uh this is coming from theNortheast um we seewinners battling out through the windfirst place 100,000second place $75,000 for second placethat\\'s yeah we talk about that hungerGrand the whole time but that\\'s 75 forsecond 50 for third and 25 for fourthall strong differen makingfunds in a professional surfer\\'s life ofcourse John John the onlyformer pipe master in thisfield seems they\\'re now all clumpedtogether out there with Billy trying toseparate himself from the pack and maybeSeth following him abit 5 minutes left wow this ishow I demand a recounthow it\\'s going by so fast and again withthe that\\'s another thing that you knowJohn is aware of with that clockmanagement getting those twoscores they\\'re now competing against hisscores and against the clock as wewelcome in our contest director NathanFletcher congratulations on a great daymaking that calltoday thank youSalma what was it what was it like whenyou were waking up this morning and itit looked like there was no waves andpeople are chirping in your ear sayingthings and deciding to run and it endedup being high action all throughout theday yeah yeah well today we definitelyum looked at the forecast much as youknow as much as we could to reallypredict what was coming in the futureand what was happening and so wedefinitely were checking the buoys allnight and then it came down to uh youknow Jody young and myself and the Vansguys talking about how we could uhmodify the competition and shave twominutes off of each heat which got us Ithink it was a half an hour of time andthen to the 40-minute final to where wecan complete the whole contest todaybecause the forecast looks prettyhorrendous really North Northeast swelldefinitely size but uh as we\\'ve seen itchange today you know just throughoutthe day you\\'ve seen the swell definitelygo from West and nice to north um and sowe are really crunched to get the bestconditions we could and that\\'s why wehad the day the other day where itwasn\\'t quite the ultimate pipe day butin my opinion in2023 to be a true pipe Master you haveto be able to surf six to eight foot youhave to be able to pull out your smallboards and then surf to 2 to 4 foot forairs and whatever and that\\'s why we sawJohn John really perform in thoseconditions and then I actually I washoping I\\'d be a little bit bigger todayum in this evening cuz we had a prettysolid buoy reading this morning I thinkit was uh 16 ft at 18 seconds but Ithink the wind in the swell Directionreally blew it down between here andKawai and so ultimately we had greatconditions we had small conditions andthen we had the rising swell today andthen all your scores are scratched andso then the four pipe uh finaliststhey\\'re going to have to surf in maxingPipeline and so I was thinking in myhead that\\'s really what you want to be apipe Master is be able to perform andcontest in all the conditions and thenyou have big maxing pipe for the finalyeah I mean you said it best you knowJohn John really able to Showcase thaton both days and even in an unlikely uhscenario and Billy keer he he surfedreally really solid on the smaller dayum did some really great turns uh atback door and put himself position toget the score that he needed today asdropping in isBilly yeah Billy that\\'s going to be theend of hiscampaign well Billy really performed onthe small day as well and I think peoplewere taking it as a throwaway day but inour heads we really didn\\'t want to haveit be a two- round competition which wehad to condition based last uh year andso you saw the guys who took the smalldays seriously where they\\'re in thefinal and that was that\\'s really whatmakes a pipe Master is being able to umyou know serve all the different facesof Pipeline and not just 10t perfectPipeline and uh another thing I want toreally note is I\\'d really like to thankVans for you know funding thiscompetition promoting this competitionputting their neck on the line andchanging the format for progression youknow for really the Surfers and thenalso the sport in progressing the sportbut that\\'s also better for thespectators and so you know in in my headthat\\'s a that\\'s a big bold maneuver andyou know they\\'re really funding theculture of Pipeline and what\\'s new andwhat\\'s to come and you know like peoplehave said before but my brother wasreally at the Forefront of gettingbarreled and doing aors and surfingpipeline at this this style of Surfingand so I\\'ve been seeing this you knowmost of my life and I was part of it andso it\\'s really really cool to see youknow where the future of the sport is atthe moment and where that\\'ll take usbecause we don\\'t know what the future isbut but we have seen it change a lotsince I was a kid and and I\\'ve been onthis beach you know for 40 plus yearsand I\\'ve seen a lot of people come andgo I\\'ve seen you know multiple peopledie multiple people getresuscitated and you know this is like Isaid before too this is dreams becomereality and also you know there\\'scertain cases where dreams get brokenand you go home in an ambulance soJohn\\'s the new pipe Masterschampion and I don\\'t think it could goto a better guy you see thatsmile you see that smile as Billy\\'s pingover to congratulate him an incredibleperformancebyI the best in the world at this momentall around for me uh for John John andhe but he\\'s so modest and so humble andin in his calculation of of and knowingwhat it would have mean uh to to winthis event and he never ever made itseem like it was a shoe in in any wayshape or form his brothers took it tohim as hard as they could and pushed himand um John John Florencejoining Moana JWang as our men\\'s and women\\'s respective2023 buam pipe Masters we\\'re going tosend Dr Clifford Kono down to this tothe stage as he\\'s going to host theceremony I got to say you know what awin that must feel really good forJohn um he\\'s definitely in a differentspot in his life congratulations on himgoing to be a father at some point soonand I feel like he took it as serious ashe takes anything in his life thisdefinitely wasn\\'t just a hand me downyeah it it wasn\\'t just a happy to behere no he he brought his aame and itreally showed and he\\'s getting walked upthe beach by his brothers kanakaSolutions and this is definitely one forthe record books and that\\'s anotherthing too is

call didn\\'t go your waythis absolves all of that I mean this isyou couldn\\'t ask for more and this istruly you know this is this is an eventthat I believe we\\'ll look back it\\'s likeoh this was a shift this was this was adisruptive shift in what the future uhcan look like especially in what it\\'sdone for women atpipeline it\\'s second to none for thewomen at pipeline I feel like they\\'rejust getting started and also too I alsofeel that you knowuh it\\'s the most captivating to theaudience to see stuff that people havenever done and I feel like really youknow all the women all theirperformances you know that\\'s that\\'s newthat\\'s never been done and there\\'s thosethree look at the littleMusketeers I love it man I love the waythey\\'ve been having fun on social mediawith their theirbeards and you know they they\\'re all forone and one for all but but UniqueIndividuals at Le as well within thesport and it\\'s perfect day and how aboutthis crowd on aTuesday on a Tuesday

school across the street theseguys arehomegrown 100% this is their backyardand it really really proves that youknow time put in time really pays offand I feel like John doesn\\'t know whatto do right now he\\'s so happy just to gohome and relax afterthis well we\\'ll find out what what he\\'sgoing to do where his mind\\'s at cuz he\\'swith Holly right now uh yeah John Johnjust came in from his second surf everat pipeline uh how\\'s that feel it feelsso good to those ones are so hard thosetypes of Heats when it\\'s just there\\'snot a lot of good waves um it\\'s a grindyheat so it feels good to win it but wastough I wanted to have a good battlewith everyone and just the right wavesdidn\\'t come yeah but I\\'m so I was sogood to watch congratulations thank youfantastic thanyou the smile says it all andum I\\'m sure Mama Florence right now issmiling really big Imean the the manner in which shehelped to set the path for for theseboys from the time that they were yayhigh to to say this this this is yourlife she really put him here like therewas this was Destiny and it\\'s funnybecause she almost knew that it wouldhappen but you could never know but Iremember watching John John when he wasjust a little kid and and you reallyknew you could see the difference in hissurfing and then there was a littleperiod when he is about 14 or 15 wherepeople speculated this and that and Iremember going on a boat trip with himand he was a little guy and then thenext year we went on the boat trip and Iwas he was 16 and once he turned 16 youknew that he was going to be the best inthe world yeah for for a kid to be sortof ordained at a very very young age asthe the second coming of Kelly Slater umto be mentioned in in the in the sameranks as as Andy and Tom Cur and Etc tobe on the cover of of Surfer magazine at12 years old that\\'s a lot to live up toand a lot to live up to especiallycoming from such a small island and whathe\\'s done with it with each time he\\'scontinued to fulfill another prophecy ithasn\\'t shaken him he\\'s he\\'s had thisability to stay centered um despite allthe we didn\\'t even talked about all theinjuries that he\\'s gone through thatcould have ended his career uh it it\\'sit\\'s it\\'s just great to watch and seewhere he\\'s at yeah I really feel thatJon\\'s going to uh continue like this ishis life this is his path but right nowI feel like he\\'s just getting his stridehe\\'s a real man and what I\\'ve noticed islike 30 to 40 you\\'re in your Prime it\\'snot you know everybody thinks oh you\\'rein your Prime and at 18 to 25 but uh ifyou take care of yourself and you tryhard and work hard and with his naturalability I feel like we\\'re going to seesome strong performances you know fromJohn and from 30 to 40 I feel like he\\'sjust getting to know himself and knowwhat he likes he\\'s coming into his ownand he\\'s strong enough and educatedenough to really take advantage of thesenext couple years yeah and you know hehe becoming a two-time pipe Master todayRoy Russell Derek Ho and now you can addJohn John Florence to that list of oftwo-time pipe Masters that\\'s and alongwith Milana she\\'s a two-time pipe masterand we also had Rory here today who is atwo-time pipe master and I feel like oneis something but when you do two itreally your spot is like a true pipeMaster indeed it does it it has been anincredible 3 days I think they arewaiting for you me on the beach oh I\\'mout yeah we love you slma I love you ohyou\\'re staying Holly you\\'re wrong Hollycame in here and tried to Holly came inand uh almost uh she almost threw thethe the post show she tried to stealyour company I was I\\'m not doing this bymyself well let\\'s uh take a look at howthis thing all startedhuh this morning you made the choice totrust thebuoys I did make the choice to trust thebuoys and I also made the choice uh onthe forecast as far as you know lookingto see in the future and what thecapabilities were of maybe having allwomen in a women\\'s final today and thengoing into men another day with a men\\'sfinal but that just really wasn\\'t anoption I felt you know with theconditions we had all the way up toHarry Bryan\\'s wave was phenomenalpipeline it definitely got tricky lateron but you can\\'t control the weather andyou know you can\\'t control the forecastso we did our best we tried to geteverybody out there and as good as andMoana is just an absolute Beast I got totell you I mean you can see that this isbefore the sun has fully come up shortlybefore this maybe an hour before this itwas flat it was flat but you knew it wascoming because those buoys they tend tonot lie and you can really try you knowforecasting when it\\'s a week out that\\'sjust all speculation until it gets to beabout 2 days away once the wind hits thewater you have a much better idea ofwhat\\'s going to happen and then thewaves hit the buoy and when you when ithits the buoy you reallyknow that was the the Emi wave at backdoor and it was just a festival allday that was one of my favorite waveswas rayaru and you know he was rightthere he just didn\\'t get the exit butthe drop and the commitment and thenHarry\\'s wave right there oh the first 10rayar\\'s wave probably would have been a10 as well but that that Harry Bryantwave was insane the foone ball lookedlike it wasCGI he\\'s really had uh I mean just a Idon\\'t know a string of luck or justDestiny but with his back door wave lastyear where he got that huge back doorone and then he he\\'s like the slowcreeper guy to where it was like thirdround he got the 10 um but I feel likethose are two of the best waves of hislife at pipeline 100% and they both camein this contest and I don\\'t think heexpected it but uh you know it\\'s it wasNature\\'s order it just gave it to himand uh I\\'m sure he couldn\\'t be happierfor sure uh this wasalso a pipe Masters in which people hadto work and and pipeline flexed you knowwe saw a lot of people uh going over thefalls we had a couple of injuries as wewere aware ofbut in order to be great at pipeline youhave to pay the tax and there\\'s a largetax to pay I don\\'t know if it\\'s 7 or 10%over here you know what I mean but andthat\\'s what we were saying too thelineup\\'s not regulated anymore and it\\'snot in a contest but pipeline regulatesyou know what I mean the wave does theregulating it just picks you and so asmany times have you surfed it uh that\\'sjust more the odds of the chance thatyou\\'re leaving in an ambulance and it\\'sreally not bad until you leave in anambulance and you know those times andit\\'s it\\'s it\\'s different than justgetting a little bang or bump FrankieHerer had somehow had two of those umthere\\'s Ava Wong U that she was beingtended to at the beach and they ended uptaking her to the hospital for furtherevaluation to make sure she was okayBethany Hamilton was just chargingsending herself out over wave after wavethis too you can see that the swell isrising and it was really jacking and uhit was really hard to make it down theface at that point and uh theydefinitely were going as hard as theycould go and it was amazing more peopledidn\\'t get hurt in my opinion yeah sothis is definitely the Highlight uhWipeout reel 24wipeouts uh total uh with Amo zurac alsotaking a trip to the hospital we we wishhim uh and Ava both uh a quick recoveryand right now I believe we are going togo out to the main stage and uh hand outsome some beautiful trophies and somechecks and Crown someChampions and those are some HappyCamp all right Aloha everybodyaloh[Music]uh big congratulations to all

could there\\'ssometimes in in some sports right wherethings aren\\'t going uh a competitor\\'sway or the field conditions whateverpeople people might take a play off orjust say like whatever I\\'m over it youdidn\\'t see that energy at all today asthe conditions deteriorated theseSurfers only threw themselves more inthe Harm\\'s Way challenged themselvestrying to to to do their best they couldto move forward in this event and thatto me was it was it was the heart and Ialso thinklike the appreciating and belief of whatthis particular event means definitelyand what I really saw was uh you knowthe first two rounds were not laxed butbecause of this format people were kindof surfing at a level and but man oncethat third day started the excitementand the energy and really it just hadsuch a different uh feel to it today Ireally feel like people came and reallygave it their all today there was no uhyou know no slacking in effort and andtoday was something different once thethird round started you really saw theguns come out it wasn\\'t a joke todayyeah I don\\'t I don\\'t even think it was ajoke before I think it was just there\\'sthe the format breeds a little bit morehappy gol lucky right it does and thenbut man the third round there was nothappy gol lucky all that was out thewindow and you saw the leaderboardchange so many times today where extingyeah you saw people just see it in theireyes to be able to get onto theleaderboard even if they are seventh oreighth or whatever all they needed theywere calculating scores they werewatching Heats and it was a littledifferent vibe today than the uh lastcouple days which I really I really liketo see so some contests it\\'s a leadup tothat you know you get to the semis andbut you\\'re already out yeah you know insenses but this it\\'s like your your yourlast Heat is like that\\'s your go youcould pull it out you could pull out youknow 230s or something and go all theway from the bottom onto the leaderboardI think Billy keer did a prettyoutstanding job at that I agree I agreeand the women really setting the tonethis morning not just for the event butalso for the future of what women\\'ssurfing looks like atpipeline an interesting one that I sawtoo was Mikey February started with alead and then he didn\\'t get much wavesand he was just dangling in fourth andthen it was just like oh it was a matterof time but this wave here from MoanaJones Wong sort of set the tone whereshe was really starting to feel it uhCarissa showing that all this extra timeChris Moore has put put in at pipelinecounting Molly picklum I mean herperformance her backhand attack and whatshe\\'s done in the last year incrediblemy favorite part about uh Molly too wasshe didn\\'t just get barreled she cameout and slammed the lift with like youknow I want to say pure aggression butshe didn\\'t let anything go towaste AaronBrooks definitely put on the show 16yearsold just weaving andthreading yeah this angle I really likeright here you could see her smiling inthebarrel Moana Jones Wong just having allof thefun and she said you know she reallyfelt like the waves that she wanted cameto her it was

Gold and he no when he did catchthat waveno inflation vest at the time doing anold school style which is uh which isgoing to be rare because as our safetyprotocol and Equipment has evolvedyou\\'ll see

scary waves look reallycomfortable the way that he rides themhe\\'s definitely comfortable out here andI mean he\\'s one of the favorites forsurewaves crashing through there and Surfersstill anticipating larger sets sitting alittle bit further out of the brake lineas we fly by here high up abovebeautiful morning here at Waimealooking to round off our heat out therein the white jerseythe

Healy41 years old this is healy\\'s fourthEddie Mark made a bit of surf historyyears back at the Eddie taking a couplelefts out here at ymail which is prettyunorthodox yeah I mean Mark Healey isknown as the guy that is fearless and ithas trained for for years on even withas a free diver and he knows how to holdhis breath here we go John John Florenceis going to start off the day just alittle test away for Florence and cutsgets caught up in the Whitewater divesoff so that\\'s gonna be our first scoreof the morning when we look at scores inthe format of this year\\'s Eddie big waveInvitational in memory of Eddie Aikau weare using a one to ten point scalefor each of the rides with half a pointoptions so keeping it nice and cleanthere you either got a point a 0.5 twopoints all the way up till 10 and that\\'show we\\'re gonna do our scoring Isaiahyeah then John John we\\'ll see uh howthat went I think you\\'re right kite wellI was just kind of getting in his feetin the wax I suppose andboth John\\'s aren\\'t kind of cool thathe\\'s the first one to start us off inthe morning so he\\'ll be getting outthere looking for some bigger rideswe were rounding off our heat and wehave yet two competitors to ID out thereas we take a look here dropping in Intothe Blue Jerseybearing gold it looks like it could verylook like very much like Shane Dorianout there who\\'s in the actual blackJersey Shane Dorian he\\'s the veteran ofThis Crew 50 years old he\\'s been arunner-up here before waves in the backand two goofy foots up there so whitethat would be KOA Rothman as well asorange as Mark Healey we\\'re just talkingabout Mark so we got some scores on theboardyeah one thing unique too about thisevent you wouldn\\'t normally see peoplesharing the same wave but at Waimea Benat the Eddie I call it is allowed yes aslong as so there is an interference butyou\\'d have to blatantly get uh insomeone\\'s in someone\\'s way so we\\'ll getwe\\'ll get to that as we go over ourrules but there\\'s options ofinterference if you do hinder someone\\'sline uh out there but that one lookedclean between Mark Healey as well asCarl Rothman we saw Shane Dorian andhe\\'s 50 years old out of Hawaii Islandthis is Shane\\'s sixth Eddie and Shane uhwas a runner-up in 2001 to Ross ClarkJones a 2001 champ out here uh two timesthird place finish that was 2004 as wellas 2016 for Shane Dorian could this beShane\\'s year we\\'ll start off with thereplay Isaiah this is John John I cansee a very tall wave it\\'s got a littlebit of that morning warble to it whichmay have contributed to that fall at theend but beautiful Drop nonethelessthat\\'s another angle beautiful droneangle shot and this was the one of ShaneDorian a late takeoff goes behind theboil there you can seemanages to get through that section ofwhitewash exploding behind himand he rides out of it which is great tohave a successful ride through thatexploding section of Whitewater gettingthrough some of the bump and chop fromthis morning sometimes on the NorthShore we call them morning sicknessbehind them we have the two goofyFooters Mark Healy and Cole Rothmanjust a quick drop and out for KOA andMark riding this wave a little furtherlooks like John John paddling for thisonethis is a different way of drops in youcan see behind that boil as well takes abottom turn rides through this see if hecan get through that whitewash and hedoesso John John Florence already with twowaves ridden again a reminder after yourfourth wave you gotta paddle in that\\'sall you\\'re going to get but John John isquick to strike out here and we\\'re goingto see uh how the the scores comethroughyeah so beautiful morning here in Hawaiiand at Waimea Valley and Waimea Bay andfortunate here to be able to watch thesegreat Surfers in this heatwell let\\'s talk a little bit aboutWaimea Isaiah\\'s but first let\\'s talkabout John John on his second wavebeautiful wave drops in behind thatsectionexplosion behind him which contributesto the uh and the excitement of thiswave manages to get around thatwhitewashsee how deep he is on this wavereally makes for higher scoring pointsif you\\'re behind that wave as you\\'redropping in and are able to ride throughthat section that is in front of youcriteria yeah so Waimea Bay is part ofthe ahupua of of Waimea Valley and ampuais basically a villager Community that\\'scentered around a riverand it\\'s known as the one of theLuscious and most fruitful communitiesespecially even in Old Hawaiiit\\'s also seen as a center for Hawaiianculture even todaybut particularly it was seen as aspiritual center in times of old whereHigh priests like high priests have ahevawho is kamehameha\\'s high priest orKahuna Nui and he resided over this areaof of Waimea ValleyRyder here dropping in it looks likeit\\'s going to be blue and that\\'s AaronGoldall right there\\'s a little frothy onewhich in surfing refers and there\\'s alot of foam on the face of the wavewhich is the result of the previouswaves that broke in front of it thosecan often be challenging to to navigateand bear with us as we go and try to IDsome of these Surfers we\\'re looking forinformation from the beach to make surethat we have because we start we have 40in invitees butwe do have an incredible alternate listof surfers so there may be somesubstitutions in this in these Heats andumtrying to find out exactly who\\'s out inthe water is going to be key we\\'re goingto be iding them out of just surfingstyle here\\'s a style right here with inblueyeah again you can see the surfer wasable to get around that it was tricky toget around through the foamy section youcan see it here as wellyeah I do believe that\\'s Aaron Goldso we got some some scoring done we\\'llupdate you on the standings this is thefirst heat of the morning 45 minuteHeats in this round number one fiveHeats in this first round ofI would say spiritual competition in away Isaiah because this is unlike anyother contest uh in the worldyeah and that that really attributes tothe to the attributes of Waimea Valleyand Waimea Bay there\\'s a lot of inHawaii we call Mana and Mana it\\'s kindof like this energy this spiritualenergy that that accompanies the thewriters and the um the islands in theocean and Waimea Valley is definitely apart of that tradition of carrying a lotof ManaI think this is Andrea Moellersir Andrea Mueller on her first wave anduh is going to go complete on thatand so completes the ride and there yougo well history made the first waveridden by a woman in competition here atthe EddieI think it\\'s only fitting becausetraditionally in Hawaiian Societywomen were very active in all of theHawaiian word for surfing and so I thinkit\\'s beautiful to have so many wahine orwomen in our event this year at the yetia little more replay of Andreayeah you see you\\'re dropping down thereand was able to make this wave a tallwave not the biggest wave of the heatbut nonetheless successfully written andshe\\'ll be out there still has three morewaves to catchyeah as we mentioned before AndrewMuller she\\'s a a great Surfer as well asa world-class paddler has set a a lot ofRecords a lot of wins both a stand-uppaddling prone paddling canoe paddlingboth in a one-person canoe as well as acrewand has also written some big big wavesum at jaws andin the tow Arena as well rightand you\\'ll hear a lot of we\\'ve talkedabout 88 Kyle that he was a watermanWaterman water Woman these terms reallyshow that that an individual who has adiverse ability in the ocean whetherit\\'s paddling canoes surfing big wavesdiving fishing a variety of differentthings so it\\'s really cool that Andreacomes from a real diverse background ofriding different watercrafts and beingan athlete and so I know she\\'s she\\'s setsome records for crossing channelsbetween islands as a paddler and so it\\'sdefinitely someone who\\'s familiar withthe power of the Mana of the oceanI was talking about Waimea Valleypreviously and how it was known as kindof a spiritual center in times of oldand one of the high Priests ofKamehameha have a hevato make a connection with uh Eddie Aikauhave have us also the ancestor to theicons to Eddie Aikau and his familyand so there\\'s a really cool connectionand spiritual vibe that brings us rightto the Aikau familyEmily Erickson she\\'s on her way outshe\\'ll be in pink in the nextheat and Emmy EricksonDad Roger was a great big Wave Rider andEmmy Erickson out there taking out aSingle Fin a Kyle Larson 10-6 that\\'s herOld Faithful you could see it beingrepaired over and over again we talkabout Mana there\\'s a connection betweenEmmy and that board and it\\'s evidentthat that\\'s her you know her go-to forbig waves yeah a lot of times people sayyou have your favorite board or yourmagic board you put it on ice or have itsit on the side but looks like she\\'s puta lot of time into that board and uhevidenced in some of the repairs thatare that are fixed on it but lookingforward to watching her out hereyeah it looks like she\\'s got some abrace on the knee so and that\\'s going tobe a story uh going throughout today inthat we have a number of invitationSurfers that have been invitedcompetitors that will be surfing withinjuries because it\\'s so it\\'s soprestigious to be in just invitedto this gathering this competition thiscelebration of Eddie Aikau thata lot of these men and women will not donot want to give up that opportunity andwe\\'re going to see a lot of surfersout there taped up braced up ready to goyou know regardless because the bay iscalling the day today and they\\'reshowing upyeah these athletes are are Chargers inother words they surf a lot of dangerouswaves and because of that uh it\\'soften time that they\\'ll they\\'ll suffersome injuries but hopefully everyone ishealthy and we pray for everyone\\'swell-being today in the water becausethese waves are are beautiful and fun towatch but at the same time incrediblydangerousforeignin the purple jersey as we said beforehe\\'s a former champ 2009 Greg Long tooka big win hereat the Eddy and really put him on thespotlight of global big wave surfingtaking out Kelly Slater that year whowas in the lead throughout most of theevent and Greg Long coming through inthat final heat of the day and snatchingthat Victory it would have been thesecond for Kelly Slater of course Slatera champ here back in 2002yeah and he really solidified it likeyou said at the end of the day and Iremember that massive one it was his hisbest wave of the day where it lookedlike the section was just closing out infront of him took a really late drop andwas rewarded for his courageous uhcharging of that massive waveout there in the black Jersey we talkeda little bit more about Shane Dorian andhis history here680i cows so Shane\\'s actually one of theveterans in this year\\'s competitionShane\\'s been through and surfed withdifferent generation of Waimea Surfershe\\'s going to see the Young Guns rightnow but Shane\\'s was surfing with Clydecow Clyde ikau winning this eventyounger brother of Idiot won this eventin 1986. correct Shane was surfing withkeoni Downing who is a legend in surfingas as well as keoni\\'s Dad George whoused to be the event director for theEddie keone winning in 1990 rightShane was surfing in 1999 when a youngNorth Shore Surfer made a big name forhimself Noah Johnsonyeah it was cool because um I mean NoahJohnson originally also from Big Islandfrom Hilo and so it\\'s really cool thatuh 1999 you know I was able to get outthere and I remember Shane doe I meanShane doe and I also grew up on the bigisland and he he would fly over herewhen he was young and surf Waimea Bayfrom a young age from his uh high schoolyears and so Shane door is definitelynot a stranger to big waves there\\'smakuokai Rothman with the brace on hisknee we talked about these Warriorssurfing through injuries because it\\'s soprestigious to be a part of this eventoh makua has a badly engineered I thinkit\\'s an ACL or MCL I mean he\\'s going tohave to go and and get get some workdone on it I talked to McCoy he said heyI\\'m not going to miss this for anythinghe may have a leash attached to a vestrather than his leg so he\\'s not gettingget pulled on that bad knee or makuaalso told me heyI may not even wear a leash because if Ifall I\\'m not going to win and I I lovethat kind of spiritwas injured at the backdoor shootoutrecently it had to be carried off thebeach and soI\\'m also surprised that he\\'s going forit because we\\'ve hit you know his kneeinjury was pretty pretty bad uh but wesee that like you\\'re saying kaipo thatkind of warrior spirit I remember at the220 uh 2016 event Uncle clydecodislocated his shoulder during thecompetitionthey reset it on the beach he paddledback out and continued surfingthroughout the event so Warriors indeedare in this eventand it\\'s shaping up to

Dorianand we know that Shane will go so we\\'llsee it was a black or perhapsumthat blue of Aaron Gold here we got toget an ID and it looks like it\\'s it wasforeigngold on on that deep one on the paddleback outyeah look like oh you know what actuallyI take that backcould be Greg Long on his opening waveyeah it looked like we had two Riders onthat wave one deeper into the wave whichmeans it\\'s closer to the to the peak ofthe wave or behind the peak of the waveand then another Rider that was sittinga little further on the end or what wesometimes called the shoulder of thewaveso we\\'ll be able to ID that soonlines coming through here on thebuilding swelland we were talking a little bit aboutthe history of ymail what abouttalking about the great service thatEddie ikau brought to the community outhere on the North Shore not just anincredible Surfer but also the NorthShore\\'s first lifeguard saving hundredsof lives in his career yeah he saidunder his watch and he didn\\'t lose onepersonas a lifeguard at Waimea Bay in fact hewas also the first lifeguard to to bestationed at Waimea Bay because it wassuch a dangerous place that you knowthey they were worried that uhlifeguards would be liable and it wouldbe too much to handle sobecomes the first lifeguard at WaimeaBay in the1967-68 uh winter seasonand is known for being a quiet gentlemanactually but very prominently active insaving lives and rescuing people at thebay here at Waimea so the paddle backout there as we get this drone shot wecan see the blue jersey that would havebeen Aaron Gold on that wavesagain 45 minutes in this round one foreach of the Heats we\\'re going to addfive minutes for round number two thisafternoon as we anticipate the swell tocontinue to build here at Waimeaand thank you for joining us here onSurfline as well as on K High For Thislive broadcast of the 10th running ofthe Eddiesecond wave in the set and a big wall ofwater Isaiah and this Surfers are gonnahave to make a decision right now longwall stretching out in front you can seethe boil there evident we\\'ll see if wehave any takers on this first wave ofthe set oh my goodness that is a bombthat\\'s a good sign this well is rapidlyrising and that was a significant waveyou could see it Barrel on the on thatsection and maybe the Surfers weren\\'t inposition or there was too much watermoving up the face but that wave wasincrediblelaunching it to this oneand grabbing the rail through the insidethere that is Mark Healey in the orangeJerseyand Healy gets exploded but I love thego forward attitude of Mark HealeywowHealy no problemtakes the beating right back on to hisboardMark Healey one of the uh an incrediblefree diver and hasoutstandingbreath holding technique so this is aguy that can stay on the water for fourminutes right he\\'d have these trainingvideos actually of trying to show peoplehow to do it and the way that hecontorts his body and keeps that air inhis chest here we have a replayoh straightening out there that waspurple so that was Greg Longgetting to some of these replays AaronGold that\\'s why he was paddling back outhe had to ditch the board thereand a little leash test for Aaron Goldand here we go with Mark Healey yeahthis is that last little Mark Healeythat one barrels behind him he grabs therail to the bottom turnso that would be one of his better wavesfor this heat so far and again ourSurfers are allowed to catch four waveswhich is unique to other competitionsand they have to be selective in whichwaves they choose to go onthat\\'s right so two rounds four wavesallowed to be caught in each round topthree waves are going to be what aretally together for your place on theleaderboard and the crowd is one thingthat we always expect here at the baywhen the Eddie runs yeah apparentlypeople come down Camp here before hoursif not days before to make sure thatthey\\'re here to watch this actionand it\\'s exciting that it that the eventwas held this doesn\\'t happen quite oftenin fact usually it\\'s about every everydecade you\\'ll have the event three timesuh about on average about three times wedid find that interestingly with umbetween the years of 1999 and 2009 that10-year period it was held five timeswhich is pretty unusual uh in comparisonso we haven\\'t had the event since 2016and so we\\'re excited to be here todayseven years later that\\'s right here wego another set coming through and notakers on this one maybe a little paddleon the shoulderlooks like Andrea Moellerand Mueller getting another wave andcollecting some points for that oneyeah that was a hot streak from a1999-2001 and 2002back to back to back years running theEddy but that was very unusual becausethe bay calls the day right Isaiah itneeds to be 20 foot plusand peaking during the daylight hours sothat\\'s one of the caveats that really uhcomes into play rightthis is so this is in the corner andthis is where our Surfers will launchinto the shore breakand to begin their paddle out trying toutilize the currents right Isaiahcorrect now the current will pull fromthe right side of your screen to theleft side of your screen once they geton the water they need to time thispaddle out because with that currentpulling you have a chance of gettingpulled all the way to the other side ofthe bay into the Rocks if you don\\'t hitthat window and hit that channel so justgetting out to the lineupis a contest in itself yeah it is andyou especially don\\'t want to make yourway too far to the to the West End ofthe beach or like you said where the bigrocks are but also the shore break thereis crazythere\\'s a replay there of Andrea Mohlerit\\'s a quick up and outit\\'s great I think this is her second oreven third wave so she\\'s staying activeand I\\'m sure she\\'s ecstatic to be aparticipant in this year\\'s Eddie bigwave Invitational in memory of EddieAikauyeah we were talking about the the Runof events from 1999 when Noah Johnsonwon two years later 2001 When Ross ClarkJones and then two then the next yearthere in 2002 and Kelly won and then2004 Bruce iron so that was a real likesolid run of of event and uhso that\\'s a little unusual like you weresaying kaipo to have that many in adrove but we\\'re excited that we\\'re backhere in 2023 yeah and we do have alittle piece on Bruce irons we\\'re goingto play that for you at some point inthe in the uh in the broadcast today andlook back uh at the win for Bruce ironsthat was in 2004 when Bruce was able totake out this prestigious title anotherguy who\\'s got that prestigious trophy onhis mantles on your screen right therethere\\'s a two-time World Champ John JohnFlorence our 2016 Champion butBruce irons reallyum innovated the way to surfing incompetition he took it all the waythrough the shorebreak let\\'s learn moreabout Bruce science as Bruce irons looksback at his win in 2004. that was myfirst heat and that was uh that wasactually the last wave I could catch anduh the waves were peaking right thereyou know and uh Kelly was in my heat anduh I think Ross Williams and these hugeyou see the lines coming and I was likeoh here it comes you know and I remembereveryone kind of started piling out andI kind of just held a little bit lessthan they did you know like they allwent like 10 or 15 feet out and I wasI didn\\'t want to get stuck on the top ofthe wave you know so I was like I\\'mgoing to stay right here and that wavecame and it was it was it was a big waveand uh Kelly was right out for me on theside and I wasand I was already in my rage and I was Iwas going to go no matter what[Music]it was my last wave so I was gonna rideit as far as I could to the beachbecause that was it and you know that inbetween stage it\\'s just like this longsailing like you can hear thecommentator and I could hear the crowdand he\\'s like oh is he getting anothershort break and on my mind I wasn\\'tthinking about that yeah it ended upcoming to the inside and you know justpulled in that close out and just gotblown up the beach and walked right tothe shower it was like it was as perfectas it could have got for me you know[Music][Applause]foreign[Applause]s from the years here at the Eddie bigwave InvitationalBruce irons Isaiah taking it all the wayto the shore break and a win yeah that\\'sShowmanship at its finest and we\\'retalking earlier about the competitorsright now that are making their waythrough that lineup they\\'re trying toavoid that short break and normallythat\\'s what you want to do but Bruceyounger brother of Andy Ironsin 2004 really took the Spotlight by uhputting an exclamation point on hisvictory by pulling into a massivecloseout shore break wave at here atWaimea Bayyeah that was uh an incredible momentlook at the lines that we got on ourscreen right now goodness more setsstacking upand gonna be hitting the peak here atWaimea competitors all in a packholding their positions and I\\'m sure theWaimea Surfers say that this is thetoughest part to do is just to hold theline you want to scratch for the Horizonbut if you do you\\'re not going to be inposition to Catch the Wave first wavejust the indicator on this set and lookat all the lines we\\'re going to see somedecisions and some positioning right nowit\\'s amazing if you\\'re not aware when wesay the set he\\'s coming there\\'s a set ofwaves you can see those lines and twoRiders up Healy andblue and that\\'s Aaron Gold Healy deep onthis onesecondMark Healey is going to ride this onethroughandmaybe thinking that this may be the endof his heat and we\\'ll see if he takes itto the shore break we saw that littleflashback of Bruce irons taking it tothe shore break Healy looking like hehas the same intent has to hop over acouple of these double ups and thatone\\'s Just Gonna Rollto the shore we\\'ll see if he decides topower back out or if he\\'s going to takeit up on the beachthat was a massive set and a long ridethere for Mark Healy and you saw thatshore break in how it pounds[Music]in fact Eddie Aikau was known to save alot of people from this shore break thistreacherous shore break heresaid that one of his strategies was ifyou if you save them too soon they won\\'tlearn their lessonso we had a technique of allowing peopleto feel the Mana of this short break andas they were getting in uh close to theshore break and he had worn thembeforehand in fact the white malelifeguards will tell you today the bestway to keep people safe is to keep themaway from the water line as you see thatwater comes up like that if you\\'re tooclose to the shore it\\'ll sweep you offyour feet and drag you out into thatshore break and Eddie ikaw was known forsaving many people precisely who are inthat kind of a predicament now you cansee Mark Healey taking himself over intothe corner there where there\\'s more of asurge and not as much of that crunchingshore break that you will find in themiddle of the beach or on the other sideof the beach so smart exit for

whowe are talking about and the way thatthat he was uh you know known to livehis life and of course being the firstlifeguard Here Eddie saving thousands oflives andum you know went out doing uh that verything for his good friends on board thatvoyageout there in the orange Jersey is makuaKai Rothman makua 38 years old he\\'s aformer big wave World Champ 2014.makua\\'s out there surfing through thepain didn\\'t want to miss this one blewout his knee at the at the shootout hashis all braced up he knows he\\'s going toneed some surgery and some work on thatbut he\\'s not missing the day yeah youknow walking uh the shot of him walkingon the beach before his heat I noticedthat brace you know it\\'ssuper Hefty and for obvious reasons butyeah that heat at the shootout I mean itwas a a really treacherous day for foreven that particular heat where BillyKemper the day before makua Kai Rothmanand kala Grace all surfing for the sameteam and um you know just had a seemedlike a barrage of injuries at the timeand I saw makua on crutches and he wasgoing to get his MRI and um uh you knowall the tests done that evening that heinjured it and it didn\\'t look good youknow as far as you know from my visualassessment when he showed me and waskind of moving it around or touching itand it\\'s like oh man you know hoping thebest for you andsure enough it\\'s going to need a lotmore medical attention but he ispowering through andnot going to miss this opportunity and Iwas kind of wondering you know after Isaw that injury like oh and if it doeshappen what you know he\\'s gonna have adecision to make yeah I talked to makuraand he said you know I\\'m gonna go paddleout he may have a leash attached to ofhis uh vest his body rather than to hisleg correct so that it\\'s not going topull on that bad knee I think that washis strategy his other strategy he toldme was hey I\\'m not going to wear a leashat all because if I fall I\\'m not goingto win but it looks like he\\'s got aleash on it looks like he\\'s got it allrigged up mccookai Rothman let\\'s roundout this heat I thought he was going togo you know Tommy Chong Ming style uhyou could put him on the front foot youcould put it on your front foot as wellMatt keckley another guy who would dothat Buzzy curve box another front footleash guy a little bit on Orthodox butwe got a ton of Surfers in history whohave gone for that John Roseman anotherone each their own uh well rounding outthe lineup in the black Jersey we havethe eldest Surfer in this year\\'sEddie most experienced and the mostexperienced2001 champ Ross Clark Jones is out therein the black Jersey and as we look athistory Ross Clark Jones had uhRocky was the first Surfer not fromHawaii to win an Eddie that is a prettycool uh stat you pull up there and um Ihad the pleasure of watching thatVictory uh driving one of those jet skisfor our uh our main producer anddirector here Mike Prickett back inthose days of salt and air Studios anduh he\\'s like oh this camera equipment\\'sonly worth about forty thousand dollarswe just can\\'t get it wet like whatand he\\'s like can you get close so wecan get a good shot with all the sprayscoming over he\\'s like hugging the cameratrying to keep it dry I\\'m like wowthanks Mike there he is Ross Clark Jonesuh like I said the 2001 champ theum had you know and in that final or thefinal Shane Doran was the runner-up in2001 there they took out the win thirdplace in 2001 was a guy I got to knowand he put saved me a bunch of times uhAnt-Man Ant-Man Paul Patterson I was inthe back of the ski this year at uhMargaret River and holding on for dearlife but uh Ant-Man like yourself Rockya expert in uh in jet ski operation andin water safety yeah especially in thewaves you know there\\'s there\\'s such a acalculated technique and and knowingwhat the the machine canning can\\'t doand where you can get uh for those epicshots and obviously for safety reasonswant to come in and uh mahalo Hawaiianwater Patrol and all of our brothers outthere looking after these competitorsand photographersbut yeah Paul Patterson that year oh mygosh you I thought he was going to winhe had some waves that I mean it wasmust have been so close between firstsecond and third because those guys wereall going off I\\'m gonna dig up some morestuff but I think Paul Patterson was inthe top six a couple of times during theEddie but just quite a quite a chargerhim and and his brother Jake out ofWestern Australia here we got a wave ohmananddestruction on the bottom so that lookedlike the blue board maybe a purplejersey could have been Ian Walsh bearwith us on the iding of the surfers wedon\\'t have a spotter here in our studioso Rocky and I are just using prettymuch our innateknowledge of stances recognition of theStyles The Stance yeah you look regularversus Goofy and thenum the purple and the black white inthis morning light sometimes uh resembleeach other so that\\'ll be a a little bitof a tricky ID right off the bat butwhoever that was was charging on thatdrop and that thing just exploded and hewas gone I\\'m gonna go with uh Ian Walshon that one just because I\\'m going todefault to the board color got it nowthe look at Ian yeah it\\'ll be super lateyou see the board chattering almostlosing some traction on the drop andthen once he gets to the trough it isgame over that lip was just chasing himright down on his tail and uh you knownot even the great Ian Walsh could holdon to that so you know that wave hadsome explosion yeah Ian just such agreat spokesman for the big waveCommunity as we see walking down thebeach Francis Justine Dupont he\\'s beenreading herself for the padlock andJustine has just been setting the bigwave world on fire with her performancesat places like Jaws Nazareth and mostrecently that mysterious Cortez Bank outin the Pacific yeah that crazy middle ofthe oceanwhatever it is man it\\'s just a hugechunk of reef hey looks like uh we gotKelly Slater on his first wave Rockthat was blue and uh looked like you dida little uh fun heel side Dismount justto uh test the waters a little bityeah Kelly Slater uh 50 years old geez Icannot believe and it\\'s just in anotherEddie and uh Kelly\\'s actually come theend of the monthwell as we start the world surf LeagueChampionship tour over a pipeline that\\'sgoing to be the Billabong Pro pipelineKelly is our defending champ as we startoff the year there for w-cell yeah andhe\\'s got a birthday coming up yeahso he\\'s gonna be 51.during all of this excitement wow yeahwhat a story what a uh you know comingfrom Cocoa Beach Florida you know Idon\\'t know if you guys have ever surfedover there I\\'ve been over there quite abit uh with some ties to that state andthere are hardly ever waves that areover maybe head high and you\\'ve got toget really lucky and a really goodstring of hurricane storms and whatnotto be able to have consistent surf buta guy from Cocoa Beachcoming out owning pipeline for as manyyears as he haswinning an Eddie ikauyou know 11 World titles is also veryimpressive for anybody from anywhere buthere we go check out the replay of Kellyas well oh excuse me wait a minute soagainblue though we have the surfer in bluewe\\'re watching the surfer in blueand now we\\'re looking at that Surfer inblue and thinking that is not KellySlater so I need some information fromthe beachum it looked a little different than thebelliesyou know style and whatnot and on afirst Quick Glance like we got weweren\\'t quite sure of it on the replaywe got a chance to study it a little bitand umwe\\'ll have to say that was uh that was amountain lion not a cheetah on secondlookforeignso each of these Heats are 45 minutes inthis first round and on the outsidecheck out red super late drop that wasMikey red in the red how appropriate andnow just a little uh lean back and rollup the window small kind but what a deeplate drop from Mikey red putting himselfin position for a good score that\\'s whatthe judges want to see are those hugelate dropsthe deeper you are the better for thisWaimea big wave scoring system and Mikeywas fitting those two points of thecriteria very wellmade it to the bottom had a little bitof uh uh shakiness getting through thattrough but was able toride it out here we go look at that justhuge drop that was black in the frontthat was Ross Clark Joneson the shoulder just a little too kindof caught up in the lip but Mikey rednice big dropgood deep takeoff made it to the bottomyou know kind of stumbled at the endthere butmy opinion that was really well done andthe Mikey should get maybe possiblyum look like one of the steeper anddeeper drops on a bigger wave of themorning so Mikey red turning in a goodone andthere goes Mr Kai Lennyheading outfor Heat number three Thailand from Mauisee our Surfers kind ofgathered up closely right there in atight takeoff Zone and on a normal day anon-competition day a non-eddy day atWaimea right there your entire screenwould be filled with Surfers trying toattempttheir dream wave at Waimea Bayand there\\'s all of our crowd trying tosit on every dry piece of Aina piece ofrock that they can find sometimesgetting a little too close looks likeeverybody\\'s so far behaving themselvesbut that is the scene here on the NorthShore every time the Eddie Aikau isrunningthe Crowds Aresteaming with excitement andanticipation the energy you can feelfrom the crowd on the beach when thesehuge waves roll in and a surfer isriding it is quite infectious andthere\\'s pretty much nothing like it Imeanthe waves are huge it\\'s great you canyou know but the accessibility forpeople to come down here and watch inperson uh is just an amazing scene of acrowd down there yeah just stay behindthe yellow tape please that\\'s fireseating coming out okay Rocky I had toget on the hotline and get anexplanation yeah I appreciate that sothat was not Kelly Slater out there inthe blue jerseythat is our alternate heart is up therecool so uh Beach Marshall and all youguys out there keep the informationrolling to us here on the set so we cankeep on bringing people accurateinformation

deep takeoff uh youknow right where you want to be forthose good scores Ross Clark Jones wasout ahead a little further down the lineactually got caught on the lip and hadto bail out Mikey made it all the wayand it was a pretty well written awayfrom like a big one and nice and steepas well let us say uh Mahalo to thebrothers uhhooking me up with some boards and somewaves uh I was cruising around our stateearlier this weekend so Mahalo got tocatch some waves about so good fun whileI was surfing and this looksfun to be on the beach watchingmaybe fun to be on a ski cruising on theside but on a

yeah it looks like Ross ClarkJones you\\'re a former champ possibly inthat black Jerseyand on a bomb it\\'s a big closeout thatwas a huge wave and it\\'sstayed huge all the way into the channeland look at this footage the Dronetracking Ross Clark Jones as he tracksacross this wave a couple of across acouple of jet ski tracks enough trackingthere for you so that is why we sawthose skis return to shore probably acloseout already at Waimea and writtenby Ross Clark Jones so Rocky I\\'m goingto sayin that regardrcj has got the biggest score so far ofthe day definitely the biggest wave anduh wrote it very welluh getting it you know all the way tothe bottom you\\'ve got to make the dropat least get over to that that cornersection as uh we see Eli Olson gettingready oh he is frothing and he\\'s beencoming on strong in the last uh severalyears really uh kind of finding hispath in pro surfing yeahuh so we\\'re talking about the the waterangle and how it is our unsung heroeslet\\'s hear from one of the best in thewater and his story from 2016 Zach Doylewas out there swimming all daythe plan was to be on a jet ski most ofthe day all the day we wanted to be outthere and not miss a single moment andwhen I got out in the water the waveswere so big when they would close outthe jet skis had to go to Shoreline sowhen I saw thisyou know what I\\'m gonna swim this and soI jumped off the jet ski and ended upswimming for the entire dayand I\\'d be left out there a few timeswhen the jet skis had to go and avoidingthe waves and I had to dive under thewaves and I\\'ve never felt power likethat before in any wave around the worldthere we go the story from Zack Noel andthe vision of Hawaiian water Patrol andhow they had to beach the skis whichthey had to do just again here soum hey the drill works the sacrifice isevident in uh what great storytellinglooking back to 2016 the last time thisevent ran yeah that was just uh such achilling image ofall those jet skis basically you knowand and guys upon them that are highlyexperienced watermen and the best in theworld and they are hightailing it out ofthere shows you who\\'s boss yeah well whyman is always the boss and uh just allof these Warriors really you know agreat Gathering right of the best BigWave Riders in the world whenever theEddie runs yeah andit\\'s always been that andyou\\'ve seen the event grow uh in

KaiLenny30 years old from the island of Maui andthis is going to beKai\\'sumdebut at the Eddie so he\\'s a big Forcewithin the big wave Riding community butit\\'s good to see Kai Lenny out hereright and that\\'s probably just becausewe haven\\'t ran the Eddie event in somany years because Kai has been aMainstay in the big wave surfingCommunity definitely has incredibleaccolades and has pushed big wavesurfing to a whole new level and so he\\'sone of the best out there todayand we\\'re talking about Jake Maki Jakemockey went to Kahuku High Schoolum really made a name for himself as ayoungster while charging really bigwaves last season he was recognized forsending it over the ledge on some reallylate ones and here we have that replayof not another than kai Lennyhad to make it through that white watersection and a great ride for for Kaithe Akai Lenny a surfer that\\'s beensuccessful in a number of differentcrafts he\\'s won on the stand-up paddleWorld Tour he\\'s won on the big wave

we\\'ll see how itends up at the end of the dayyeah and likeum we\\'re talking about with with some ofthe youngsters that come out here earlyin in uh we\\'re talking about Jake Makibut also with kailani made a mark forhimself when he was really young EddieAikau is similar in that way he startedsurfing the North Shore when he was only16 years of age was brought out herewith um particularly a guy named JohnKelly who was a old-timer he also servedwithum uh with the Cole family and with someof the the pioneers of Waimea Bayanother person he looked up to greatlywas a guy named kealoha uh North Shorenative from Laie who\\'s surfing WaimeaBay back with the guys like Greg Knollin the late 50s and so Eddie Aikaureally made a Mark here on the NorthShore at a young age when he was only 16years oldwent on to become the North Shore\\'sfirst lifeguards and uh saved hundredsof lives rounding out our eight bandheat we have to mention out there inBlacktile Shipman is uh in his first Eddiefrom the East side from Kailua 46 yearsold got the invite which is a huge hugecompliment to a relatively undergroundsurfer in the way of Tayo so he\\'s gothis opportunity here he\\'s in the blackJerseyyeah so we\\'re honoring at this eventEddie Aiko is actually born on Maui hisfamily he has there\\'s six of them intotal of children uh Fred Gerald SaulEddie Myra and Clydeand so his family born in on Maui hisfather worked as a stevedore in KahuluiHarbor they decided to pack up and moveto Oahu and he was only 12 years old atthe time was already surfing a littlebit on Maui his father was you know anocean guy himself and when they came toOahuinterestingly they didn\\'t have a placeto stay until they they found a dealwith a Chinese graveyard that if thefamily took care of the graveyard theycould live on the property rent freethat\\'s why I was going to bring up withyou I believe that\\'s in power on theSouth Shore where that graveyard yeahso Eddie and Clyde were known this andthe whole family in fact because they\\'reocean lovers uh his dad\\'s name was Saullike cow and his mom Henrietta and theywould go to Waikiki Beach as a youngfamily and spend a lot of time there andright there at Waikiki walls was likethe epicenter of where the kids would goand play and Surf and ride on these wellwe call pipel boards which werebasically boogie boards made out ofplywood and so young Eddie and Clydespent a lot of time at that wall ridingthese waves on these plywood boards inthe surf in Waikikithen evolved as Surfers do discoveredthe North Shore correct right yeah so uhit it became apparentapparently there\\'s a story where theirfamily was at uh I think it was aWaikiki show where they were watchingthis Surf video of of big wave surfingon the North Shore and Eddie wasmesmerized by I mentioned earlierriding these massive waves like we\\'rewatching here today he looked at his dadand he was only 14 years old at the timeand said I am going to ride the biggestwaves uh ever seen and I\\'m gonna makeour family proudand that was as a 14 year old and withinthe next couple years he ended up doingthat coming to the North Shore with as Imentioned earlierum the founder of the group called saveour surf John Kelly and surf the NorthShore when 16 years old get ready forMason oh he\\'s coming down the beachright now Mason\\'s going to be in Heatnumber four here and he prepares hispaddle out to the BayMason ho is uh got the distinct honor ofSurfing the Eddie this year alongsidehis father Michael ho which is just anincredible story and I do want tocorrect myself I called Ross Clark Jonesat 56 the oldest Surfer in this year\\'scompetition I was wrongUncle Mike65 years old is going to be out there inthe Eddy and Michael ho continues to wowthe surf world of beinggosh I\\'m going to say the best 65 yearold surfer in the world perhaps I agreewith that I just watched him at pipelinelast week charging second Reef pipegrabbing rail pulling in the barrels itwas a previous uh winner at pipelinePipeline Masters with the cast on hishand as he was grabbing rail pulling inthe back massive barrels then incredibleto have 65 year old Michael surfing withhis sonand the legacy of

really cool howhere at Waimea Bay we\\'re celebratingthese families and uh particularly theseHawaiian families we\\'re talking aboutnowokay we got a paddle This Could BeTayo shipment taking a look at that asweflip the camera thereand Tayo actually you know I mentionedfor two years from uh resigning Kailuabut he actually grew up uh across thestreet from Sunset Beach so it was wasraised in powerful surf here we go overthe fall oh my goodness before yellowthat was Jake Makiand we\\'ll identify who\\'s on the shoulderthere as we get to the replaysby just bombing sets us see set numbertwo Isaiah and what it holds in forstart if we have any takersyeah but it was so heavy Not only was ittall but it was wide and you know thosethick ones that Barrel like thatrequire a lot of courage to paddle intothose as the water as you\\'re paddlingdown the face of these waves the wateris coming up at you so being able tomanage to go down while water is comingup takes a lot of skill and couragebecause that water is also going to endup on your head if you don\\'t make itHoldings clear in the lineup all eightof our Surfers again to refresh you onthe format hereeight Surfer Heats and at the topthree waves from Two Rounds in theseeight Surfer Heats will go into yourscore here we go look like Eli Olson wason the edge there as we check out thereplay but Eli got eaten upso you can see Jake injecting Eli makingthe drop but then catching it on thebottomas I mentioned earlier that wave was sothick not only tall but wide in whichwhen that you saw both Jake was unableto um to make it into the wave becauseif wave was pitching him out over whatwe call over the fallsand Eli was able to make that drop butbecause that wave barreled so stronglybehind him was obliterated at the bottomas that wave detonated right behind himyeah Eli Olson 30 years old from theNorth Shore uh he was a double XL RedBull paddling champ in the past he\\'salso a jiu jitsu black belt Eli is andlately Eli\\'s been doing someincredible work for Hollywood he\\'s uhhe\\'s been a stuntman on a number ofmovie projects as we have a vision hereof the ski ride out for Mason ho Masonwith his trusty Pat Rawson gun under hisarmyeah we saw Mason in 2016 catch one ofthe biggest waves of the entirecompetition and you can see the wave wasactually closing out but he was ridingit nonethelessI don\\'t try to scratch into that oneunable to do that you can see theoffshore winds Isaiah holding theSurfers upin the lip so that it almost makes everydrop of airdroprighthere looks like we have a wave in theback got a rider standing up dropping iton this one backside looks like Nick vonRupp see if he can make it through thatexplosion behind him disappearsso great Style by Nick von rub Nick vonRupp hailing from Lisbon Portugal withthe Eddie coming on and off and big waveswells this is his thirdtriphalfway around the world just thiswinterNick von Rupp he\\'s been you knowchalking up some airline miles everytime he hears about the swell every timehe hears about even a possibility he\\'shopping on that plane in Lisbon andthat\\'s a long journey because usuallyit\\'s Lisbon to Charles de Gaulle Charlesde Gault in New York New York toCalifornia California to Hawaii butright now he\\'s sending it at Waimea abeautiful Drop The Wave was barrelingbehind him grabs his railtry to get through that section but itwas just too much water to handleyeah great great Style on that rail graba little bit of a tuck knee there andwe\\'ll see how the numbers come in assoon as we get updated on theleaderboard we will share thatinformation with you here at the 10thrunning of the Eddie big waveInvitational all in memory of The Lifeand Legacy of Eddie Aikauyeah so as Eddie was a Youngster livedin town up there near Papa coleo hisfamily lived on a cemetery would takethe Trek out to the North Shore as a 16year old in fact he opted toexit high school at the age of 16 buthis dad was you know pretty strict onhim so he said well you got to dosomething so we got a job working at thepineapple Cannery down there in Honoluluand would work at nights and then whatthat did was it freed up his schedulefor the daytime so as he was savingmoney at night and uh was able to catchrides out here initially with John Kellyand others and and really fell in lovewith the North Shore and was able tokind of moonlight at work and then comeand surf all day longall right so look taking a look herewe got a wave coming through we have aninterested paddler and we\\'ll see ifsomeone picks it up on the inside on thescratchclick title on the drop theresee if you can work this through ontothe insidecasual approach for the first time EddieSurfer and you know just getting invitedinto this event is an accomplishment onitself Isaiah right in fact that bringsus to a story of Duke hanamoku when hewas firstinvolved with surfing competition whenin 1965 he went and checked out theinaugural famous Duke Invitationalcompetition which was uh North Shore\\'sbig event back then in the 60sI was a it was a you know exclusive listthat he was still pretty young and notinvited in that year but the very nextyear both he and uh Ben IPA two localSurfers were invited to that eventokay we have a replay of Tayo nice dropa little bit of error under the board ashe dropped down on that wavemags backyeah so um speaking as we finish offthis replayspeaking of Duke kanamokuyeahwell with his tile right here we\\'regonna go two times on this replayspeaking of Dukan omokuumtoday is actually uh the day that Dukepassed away that that we lost DukeJanuary 22nd1968. soum gosh there\\'s just been a lot of Manaa lot of energy insignificance on thisday and that is uhso you know so powerful and that\\'s whythis that\\'s why this Eddie Isaiah youcan talk about it more it\\'s so much morethan just a surf competition exactlyand I mean it\\'s interesting how allthese pieces of this puzzle this storyare coming together too I\\'m talkingabout um you know Duke\\'s passing in 19681967 is when Eddie actually surfed inthe The Duke Invitational and they saythere\\'s this really powerful moment whenuh when Eddie Aiko made it to the finalsand got a trophy you got sixth place inthat final but Eddie Aikau anddukahanamoku had this exchange at theceremony when they were recognizing uhthe the awards and there\\'s this famousphoto of dukanamoku putting his armaround young Eddie and in some wayspassing the torch from one Hawaiiangeneration to the next and Eddiedefinitely hadum you know some shoes to fill as far aslike maintaining that Legacy and a hedefinitely did but particularly out hereat Waimea Baychecking out in yellowthat is uh the teenager Jake Makiand we saw Jake take a tripover the falls one that nobody wants totake but right now Jake getting asuccessful ridetrying to ride that through the insideand uh you know I gotta update right nowon the leaderboard and it looks likeand it\\'s early days but uh with thesingle highest wave score right now RossClark Joneswith the single highest wave score wherewe as we look at live action hereand our Surfer in red kicking out Ior actually that could have been Orangeum Landon McNamarareally close betweenred Nick von Rupp and yeah both aregoofy foot and we don\\'t have a spotterin here so uh bear with us as we ID theSurfersyou were talking about these kind ofconnections interesting that Mason hosein this next Heat I was telling a storyabout uh the Duke Invitational whereEddie Aikau was uh got the trophy fromduke hanumoku himself the year beforeDuke passes away this was at uh Duke\\'sum there was this nightclub that thatwas had there and Don Ho was theperformer and Don Ho uh the cousin ofMichael ho so this interestingconnection to the surf world and in thatentertainment community and Hawaii ofcourse is is a small island but lots ofcool connections with our stories yeahand and a lot of legacy to to beum to be celebrated Michael\\'s dad Chicoho Waikiki Beach Boy as well made thatlifestylemuch like a guy\\'s like Duke kanamokuEddie Aikau all part of the culture ofHawaiians sharing the experience tomalahini or to visitors but keeping themsafe

whois deeper on that unable to to growsuccessfully I like young Jake righthere I like his line he\\'s taking thisone through kind of the flats in theinside let\\'s see if he goes for theshore break and gets bucked off beforethe shore breakbut great effort by the young Jake Makiyeah these guys are riding big boardsanywhere between nine feet and 11 feethere we have a rider up oh as the waterbounces him off that uh wave Eli Olsenlet\\'s see it is a little tricky on someof those with the water uh chopped tothe face and saw Elitrying to make his way through that waveas it chattered him up the faceoh emerge it from the White Water thereKai Lennyin his first Eddie and we were talkingabout Kai as one of the Premier Big WaveRiders in the entire world Kai Lennysurvives the storm and energeticallypaddling back outthe new father from Maui incredible BigWave Riders put on big wave performancesthroughout the entire Globe but thistime he\\'s taken his game to the bay andhis first Eddie so great ride for KaiLennyyeah Kai has a way of making big waveslook enjoyableuh turns his board really well he\\'sworked really hard on equipment to wherehe rides boards they\\'re a little shorterthan most and you can see that the waythat he\\'s able to to turn andum that last wave looked really excitingfrom emerging from that explodingwhitewashLandon McNamarataking off on this one the surfermusician and second generation Waimeawriter here with Landon and LandonIsaiah looking like he wants to make theconnection yeah it looks like our Ridersare all going for the distance usuallyyou\\'d want to kick out but riding thisthrough this frothy foamy bumpy insidesectionand we\\'re nearing the end of this heatso I have a feeling that Landon is justtakingthe best way to shore that\\'s riding awave and he\\'s going to complete all theway throughto the shore break land in McNamaraEddie Aikau was known a lot of ourSurfers have their signature surfboardlook and Edie Aikau is known for thisred board it was a Hobie surfboard thatwhen he was a teenager and just got thatjob working at the pineapple Cannerysaved up enough money to try and getthis board apparently it was in thewindow of this surf shop and it was adick Brewer board and eventually he wasable to save enough money to buy thisboard and and look at all the photos ofhim and of memories of him that redboard really stands out for for youngEddie especially was his youngstersurfing out here Waimea Bay also worethe signature white shorts with the redstripe across it so Eddie was very umhad his Look to Him yeah it looks likeLandon not taking that one all the wayin and decides to get back out there andHawaiian water Patrol giving Landona quick ride to the channel droppinginto this one big wave out in frontTau Shipmanso great execution before the first timeEddie invitee as a paddle here Kai Lennybig drop Lenny way deep Eli Olsenfurther on the shoulder but it\\'s goingto be Kai Lenny who\\'s going to hang inhere and Lenny just with that strongstance coming through riding with Elilooks looks like both Surfers areinterested to go through the showeverybody Kyle with the Bunny Hop Elidecides to stick with it and let\\'s seewhat Eli has on the shore break hereIsaiah big section oh my goodness tripleup double up washing machinewhy may a shore break andEli Olson with a strong stance takes itall the way through a little claim toformer Eddie winner Bruce irons withthat Shore Break ride oh that was anamazing wave three guys on that wave butuh Kai Lenny was the deepest had thebest line I think behind everyone butman exciting to have this wave shared bytwo gentlemen and all the way throughthe short break we have Eli Olsonand you can see that\\'s just the insidesoup right there that\\'s just thebeginning of the story at Waimea there\\'sso much more to it but that in itself isa huge challengeyeah a lot of turbulence a lot of energythere\\'s so much power in this oceanespecially here at Waimea Bay this deepbay where the swell is coming from thesestorms way out to sea and the way itgoes from deep water to the hit or orthis Bay in here just shows all thatwater and that energy just coming to thebeachflying through here you can seethe acreage of white water that it takesafter a set in the jumbled up Bay hereat Waimea beautiful conditions offshoreconditionsincoming swell that\\'s still on the risethroughout the day making for an epicday you can see the seam right there thegiant boil out at Waimea that\\'s a partof the whole lineup here and Jake Makitaking a look at that one and decidesnot to ride that bucking wave as itrolls through here at Waimeayeah the Surfers have to be selectivebecause some of these waves areunmakeable and they want to make surethat they\\'re pulling the trigger on theright ones especially since they onlyhave four waves that they\\'re allowed ineach of their Heatsit\\'s a clear view down the North Shorecoast and our drone flying by the lineupas we see a scratch by Jake Maki hewants in on this oneJake\\'s upand a bumpy ride down the face but theteenager from the North Shore hangs onto that one cutting to this angle hereof Landon Landon marriedoh my goodness that looked like acloseout set behind themmy goodness this is reminiscent of 2016when we had those sets that would comethrough and close out the entire Baycatching up with Jake Maki here and looklike uh tile Shipman as well may uhwe\\'ll see if he\\'s still attached to hisboard may have lost his board this thisset Isaiah as we take a look hereappears to close out the entire Baywe\\'ll get a visual of thatum and maybe the angle so that it reallygives us you know theohmagnets the consequence yeah and themagnitude of this the front on angleof that closeoutif you\\'re wondering what Jake Maki justdid he\\'s trying to get under the wave sohe stood up on his board to get an extrabit of uh momentum to dive underneath itbecause all this white water is comingover you you want to try and getunderneath it touh avoid its its turbulence as much aspossible our Hawaiian water Patrolstaying busy here that was a big wavethat probably washed most of ourcompetitors out so they\\'re checking thelineup to make sure everyone\\'s safelet\\'s check out some replays here andDiving that was keala Kenley behind JakeMaki who made this wave wow Kayla goingfor itfrom the water

coachingsaying John look it here\\'s how you do itnot sure why uh Kelly opted out thisyear but I\\'m sure he has his reasonswell Kelly Slater is a is a Levitt timeWorld Champ a smart Surfer and maybe Ithink he\\'s saving himself becausestarting January 29th the championshiptour kicks off at the Billabong Propipeline where Kelly Slater is thedefending champ there so Kelly\\'s Focuswould obviously

like uhpurpleoh we\\'ll catch up to that whenwe get that Vision againso one of the years that the bay wasnoted for one of its biggest days was uh1967 on November 19th it was on a Sundayand on that November 19th the waves wereso big that it was closing out and youcouldn\\'t ride it there were two peoplewho were swept off the beach and drownedthat day but check this out live actionkailani again bunny hopping on thebottom a big mountain of white waterLenny survives that Kai Lenny putting onan impressive performance again I toldyou about at the beginning of the heat Iwas thinking that Kai is

leaderboardwe\\'ll make that more official as soon aswe get all the the numbers from ourjudges but Kai Lennyimpressive yeah incredible first roundheat for Kai he had three waves that arereally good in that heat and so I thinkyou\\'re right kite will be probably goingto see him jump up to the top of thatleaderboardKai paling back inand is gonna makethe interesting exit but uh he can holdhis hot head

broit\\'s like his skateboard when hit therock and then he just went on theasphalt but more worse when you stayaway me a beer browell thankfully Hawaiian water Patrol isdoing amazing stuff so Zeke is there uhchecking on something deflating his hisvest most likelyyeah so we\\'ve been uh fortunate with thedevelopment of Technology we\\'re nowwe\\'re have these CO2 cartridges insertedinto these vests they\\'re able to pull acord and inflate themselves in order toget up from uh you know being held downtoo long underwater and you know thattechnology has been around a while ithas on the airplaneyou know how they get that thinginvested I\\'ve played it so fast the bestoh man yeah but I\\'m glad to see itapplied in a practical sense for ourSurfers and along Kamehameha highwayright there there those folks are on thelike the the median of the margin of thewhite line those folks walking were onthe road it is parking lot status paradekind the road shut down on that\\'s why ifit was a school day you couldn\\'t go toschool because yeahparking on the road you know in themainland they got snow days on the Northshow we got Eddie daysand um rounding out some of the Surfersin this heat we\\'ve

Forefront of that andour Hawaiian Surfer in yellow from thebig island and absolute chargermulti-talented when it comes to wavewriting disciplines andso great to see him out here in theyellow along with the North Shore Zonein the purple jersey see him laying onhis board right there to the right ofyour screen Jamie O\\'Brien j-o-bthat\\'s out here in the Eddy and thenlast but surely not least you cannot uhhave a fun great surf event withoutinvolving Mason ho our Surfer out therein Orange so Mason is gonna take a crackthere\\'s his dad some Eddie action andPops yepamazing to have two generations ofSurfers in this event lots of love andAloha being shared there on the beachit\\'s another Beauty about this event youknow a lot of camaraderie people realizethat I mean this is big and dangeroussurf they want everybody to be safe soeven though it is a competition it\\'salso uh you know lots of Aloha and lotsof help that they\\'re you knowcamaraderie sharing here in the lineupyeah the vibe is that exactly as Michaelho will head down the beach and getready to be in that position you see theSurfers in Michael for the next Heatthese Surfers trying to get themselvesin the right spot for this heatedwe\\'ll see some sharing of waves we\\'llsee multiple Riders on a wave which isallowed here at uhthe Eddie I cow the big waveInvitationalyep and you can see how our our Surfersthey pick their their lineups right likewhere do I sit do I situm you know further deep or do I sit uhfurther out and we\\'re seeing a paddleherewe go red is our deepest there for airdropping into it that is Peter Mel doingit like a veteranyes sir still going strong but getseaten up at the bottom of that wave butwhat a drop amazing ride from Peter Millflew all the way over here fromCalifornia twice he was on the airplanelast week and he found out in the airthat we weren\\'t going to run the eventbut opted to of course you know come andand for both of these uh you know daysat the base call in the day today and soPetedefinitely worth it on that last rideI think it\\'s really cool rock this yearand every heat of these rounds here wego oh there\\'s a replay of him yeah thatwas just a heavy drop and then rightthere just gets engulfedin White Water look at the water anglelooking into the wavejust a beasthow that water angle really shows youhow how steep and Hollow those waves area lot of power a lot of energyum here today at the bayso saying it\\'s exciting that every oneof these Heats we have a wahine surferwhich is new to this event right we\\'veuh the first time we\\'ve actually hadfemale Surfers in the event and to havesix female Surfersreally amazing makani is our our femaleuh Surfer for for this heat and reallycool there we go a shot ofof Pete Mill paddling back out you cansee his vest uh inflated I was talkingabout that earlier where the CO2cartridge were inflated the paddle backout and you can deflate it to bring itback down I was going to say that thatthat\\'s kind of a mustkind of must-have uh technology be ableto you know deflate it back to uh whereyou can paddle and move around but mantalk about having uh emergency rip cordplan to be able toreach down and pull it out look likePeter once again in the red jersey justswinging around on one that was a littlefurther inside just to get another waveunder his belt yeahbecause in ancient Hawaiian Societysurfing uh was something that everyonedid whether you\\'re a male female youngor old okay that\\'s really cool at theEddie event here today we\\'re celebratingthat tradition of just being somethingthat people enjoy at all walks of lifeand all levels and all genders I wasgoing to touch on that a little bit asyou seeKellychecking out the conditions high and dryfor the moment he was replaced earlierwith an alternate so not sure uh if he\\'sgoing to be re-entering the event ormaybe he is uh taken this year to justCruise them and watch him but there\\'ssomewhat of a a myth or maybe amisunderstanding about surfing inHawaiian culture that it was onlyreserved for Ali or something like thatright um you know there was a bookwritten uh by Ben Finance is surfing thesport of Kings and the title had areally cool kind of ring to it I thinkunfortunately people made that uhassumption that that meant it was onlyfour Kings which is not trueum the Hawaiian historian David molowrites that surfing was a nationalPastime practice by all people nowchiefs were were often would havepriority in certain breaks in certainlineups as in all walks of life orHawaiian culture correct it was not uhseparated from the ocean right and andmost of the Chiefs too in ancient timesit was a way of of is displaying theirmana and their strength and their beautyand so so yeah we\\'d have a lot ofstories of guys like for example KingKamehameha was probably one of Hawaii\\'smost famous Chiefs was also an Avidsurferum but so is his wifeand so men and women enjoyed uh surfingor what we callin Hawaiian and so really cool to seeour our female Surfers out here in thelineup in at Waimea Bay which is ofcourse as we know some of the mosttreacherous and and um dangerous wavesyeah and you know wahine has beensurfing with us and Among Us for likeyou said Generationsand I was telling kaipo earlier you knowI from a a young kid growing up here onthe North Shore we all knew who Eddiewas what it meant and then we all hadthe posters on our wall with all thenames andum it was for a time you know the 80s90s and up until just very recently allmale contestants and competitors and Igot to give a lot of credit to thesewahine that have been out there andsurfing at Waimea as you see our nextteethdoing the heroes walk in front of thecrowd uh it is so cool to be down thereBeach level and get a good look at thesecompetitors where you you some part ofyou think that there\\'s part of themthat\\'s like Immortal not human and andnot you know just different from me as ahuman here as we watch blue on theoutside Ezekiel Lao he is puttinghimself in good positions out here yeahziklaouh Honolulu nativeand uh amazing server he\\'s on thechampionship tour meaning uh the elitegroup of competitive Surfers and thatwill start up soon as kipe wasmentioning earlier but ziklao definitelya good ride and although he grew up inin Honolulu surfing the waves in townit\\'s made a name for himself on theNorth Shore which is very similar toEddie aikau\\'s story actually grew upthere in Honolulu near papakolea at thecemetery that the family lived out ofthere and made his way out here as ayoung 16 year old surfing the NorthShore in fact he became most famous bythis one swell in 1967 where the waveswere massive he was out here with hisred board made a huge name for himselfat that day at the bay and we see apaddler here in yellow making this dropwhoa that was like Beyond vertical thatwasjust putting himself over the ledgewhen we get the replay of that you\\'regoing to see just how steep that wavewas he was looking like he was holdingon about three quarters down he had itand then there\\'s a point sometimes inthe wave where it\\'s so steep or just soinverted these nine six plus ten footboards have a hard time fitting in thatcurve and I think that\\'s what some ofthe uh trouble might have been for Kellybut absolutely charging on that waveyeah amazing from my hometown and Hiloon a big island in fact all my mybrothers uh cheering him onhere we go oh this was bluethat was Ezekiel Lao on the last one uhReplay that was really that was prettysteep you know in in regular motion itdidn\\'t look like it was uh all that bigbut when it when he got to the bottomand you saw the wave really stand up andthen you see that beautiful drone shotcoming fromthe back and looking into it as we seeKelly is board just at the last momentpenetrate the nose and not able to makeit I was justto for him to make it that far down thewave on that steep of a wave was alreadyhuge accomplishment amazinghe also lots of waves here at Waimea Baytodayglad they made the right call rightbecause last week it was almost Eddieand then uh they decided to hold off andboy the ocean definitely delivered forus todayand it\\'s on the rise still yeah thatthat\\'s a fun part of what you thinkabout these guys describing the droppretty good you see them with his handangled real his elbow was real highthat\\'s when you know that\\'s a steep dropand just one more uh bit of credit tothe wahine that are out here and andbeen because to get invited to get yourname out you got to put in so much hoursofof uh you know being out here at the bayall sizes all conditions having you knowpeer recognition is a lot of itobviously media helps with that toogetting videos and photosso these girls uh these wahine in thisevent have put in so much time andthey\\'re getting uh the payoff beinginvited to this Eddie and truly uh welldeserved and well earnedlooks like we got a paddle hereoh the wind blowing up the face whichalso adds to the difficulty of catchingwaves here at Waimea Bayyou have a lot of you it\\'s not as easyas just paddling into a wave there\\'swind coming up the face there\\'s watercoming up at you you\\'ve got the bigboard and that wind oftentimes blowingunderneath that board looks like TwiggyBaker Grant Twiggy Baker getting readyfor Heat number five we\\'ll have tworounds of five Heats eight Surfers ineach heat so we\\'ve got40 competitors that\\'ll be having twocracks at the bay today and I wastalking about earlier looking at thecrowd on the beach and the Surferswalking by so two things you really getto admire when you\\'re down there on thebeach if you can Brave the crowds and Isaw the the cars and crowds lining upfrom last night along the highway overthere but if you can get down there itis a once in a lifetime experience youget to feel the Thunder of the Waves seethe actual height from Beach level thewaves I call them Horizon ticklers whenthey\\'re just like almost coveringFeathering the covering the Horizon andthen you see these athletes walk bythese Surfers and you think of them asbeing like these huge Larger than Lifecharacters they\\'re just mere mortalslike me and you but there\\'s just socommitted and well trained and put in somuch time preparing their bodies andtheir minds it\\'s a huge mind thing to beable to shove yourself over one of theseledges that are 40 50 feet tall atWaimea Bay seeing the Rocks right therethe whole the crowd the whole vibe it isjust a lot of adrenaline and butterfliestoo sometimes yeah we\\'re talking aboutmana and that kind of energy that youfeel and Waimea Bay is got a longhistory of that mono whether it\\'s backin the valley where they have thosethree hails here or just the energy fromthe oceanyou can see our water Patrol safetykeeping everybody safe out there yeahthey\\'re pretty much operating uh on amoving River there\\'s so much watermoving you\\'re either going quickly withit or directly against it and needing tohave that incredible throttle control tomaneuver yourself in these waves safelywith Surfers and photographers allaround youand we\\'re going to check out our goodfriend Kevin Wallace who\\'s got theSurfline forecast for this Eddie swellthis powerful swell came from ahurricane four storm that was centered athousand to 1500 miles from Hawaii lateThursday through Saturday winds up to 40knots extended to an area 900 milesNorthwest of the islands as well thesestrong winds drove Peak Seas to nearly50 feet on Friday morning Hawaii timewith satellites verifying that a hugeswell is on the way we\\'re going to seepumping surf all day today although it\\'sgoing to Peak from around late thismorning through the afternoon and windyconditions going to be epic throughoutthe day as well with offshore easterlytrade windsforeignthank you Kevin and you saw somesatellite footage of the clouds and andhow the storms form and they basicallylook like giant hurricanes and these arethese low pressure storms that start offof a uh Eastern Russia as we watch alive takeoff there on the outsidemight be Jamie O\\'Brien in purple maybe adarker Jersey or could have been tikanuiSmith In Blacknow those purple and black jerseys aregonna sometimes in the shadows and inthe uh unbalanced light might look alittle bit similarbut you saw that forecast and the arrowthat was pointing at that fetch on thatsatellite image and then we saw the umthat colored uh color-coded forecastsystem that showed a lot of energypointing right at the Majestic and verydivinely situated North Shore I like howyou tell the divinely situated becauseactually the bay wasa a place of Divination in fact the hailup on the North side of the bay and onthe cliffs there above of uh pupukea wasactually one of its purpose was fordivination they would align into theactually the largest hail on Oahu uhheyo is like a structure like a templelike it is large it\\'s it\\'s Acres yeahacres and it says it goes back uh AThousand Years wow and used for variouspurposes but umis uh that you know could be repurposeddepending on the situation and time okaybut it brings that kind of Mana that theBay has uh on Shore and in the ocean andit definitely contributes to that kindof Mystiqueof this place and look at this wave herein yellowwell that\\'s Kelly your mamaso from that straight on angle sometimesit\\'s so hard to find the surfer as theyhit the bottom of the wave or the troughof the wave from the wave before kind ofblocking view out the back that is redlooks like Peter Mel he\\'s having himselfquite the day here Pete is catches hissecond wave and he\\'s successful atriding these amazing job for the Condoryeah he is up there in the experiencelevel with the a guy we saw earlier RossClark Jones a couple of the ogs gettinga chance uh here at Waimea Bay and youknow they\\'ve been frothing the lastseven years wondering when the next timethey\\'re gonna get this chance and ithappened here on January 22nd 2023I mean even though these are you knowmore seasons gentlemen they\\'ve had someof the best waves of the day so farright yeah uh Ross Clark Jones had thatbig closeout that was one of the thebest scores of the day andPeter Mel staying busy he had one rightat the beginning and cut a small littlebackup uh inside wave as we watchedKellytry to hold on through that airdrop thewind getting under the board and PeterMill yeah Pete takes a a straight linehere gets through that white washsection it\\'s able to hold onright through nicelyoh you know what that wasn\\'t Pete no ohthat was orange that was orange that wasnone other than Mason hope and the pinkand orange I mean excuse me the uh thered and orange looking a little similarthere so Mason good call Isaiah thankyou very muchand all forms of enforcement down on thebeach we saw city and county lifeguardswe\\'re seeing ourPartners at HPD city and countyHonolulu Police Department getting readyor just being on standby in case any uhwild and crazy beach goers make abeeline for the ocean try to get oncamera nah just kidding that won\\'thappen but out the back in the whitejersey that is Lucas chiankaand Lucasbeen a staple for the Brazilian big wavesurf community and as you said beforepartnering up with uh local Maui boykailani for some toe-in partnershipyeah uh exciting to watch himespecially they do those towing surfingand recently he was on that strikemission for the hundred foot wave Chaseout at Cortez Bank yeah that is such ajust a crazy crazy place to surf andsomething notable about both Lucaschianka and Kai Lenny their boards areare shorter than most of the othercompetitors it does look that way Iwould I would uh agree with thatright now his board looks like he\\'sserving sunsetbut he\\'s at the bay a lot of our Riderswill choose between like a nine foot and11 foot board usually about 10 foot iskind of common but that board lookedlike it could be even under nine feetpossibly Oh Billy Kemper so glad to seehim at least being able to make it downhere he had a pretty bad Wipeout gottaken away via ambulance during the backdoor shootout of our second of our threedays of competition that was lastSaturdayso we were I mean the warriors uh thewarrior Spirit here is alive and wellbecause these gentlemen did take abeating I mean not onlyum with uh with with our writer here butalso with uh mccookai Rothman and eventhough they\\'re injured they\\'re rightback out into this big surf so I\\'m tipmy hat to them yeah I mean it\\'s not likethey\\'re suiting up and paddling out thefour foot Rocky Pointdude they\\'re suiting up and putting onArmor basically to get out and uhmaybe not necessarily do battle becausewe always talk about the flow and thesink that you want to have with theocean to perform well while you\\'resurfing even but we do a lot of timesuse the analogy of of suiting up forbattle when you\\'re going out herebecause it is your body is just allsystems go you got to be firing on allcylinders as much as possible if we goout the back in the blue that is ZekeLau making it to the bottom emerges fromthathuge wall of white water andI mean it\\'s basically like a snowboarderduring an active Avalanche I love thatcomparison because it\\'s definitelychasing you downandtrying to get in on thatshoulder right there was I believe ourSurfer in Black tikanui Smith having alook at it but was not able to strokeinto itand justbeautiful Drone footage looks likesomething might be out the back herepossiblywe\\'re in Heat number four we\\'ve got fiveHeats total with eight Surfers in eachheat and we have at least oneor two one represented in each heatmakuni adrik the wahine surfer from theNorth Shore in pink in this seat hereand we look at the replay of white yeahhe grabs Israel Lucas from Brazilgets around that wave looking whether ornot he wants to stay with it and thisone water angle has to grab his railgives that excitement shows us how steepit really isI will sayas a fellow goofy footer it would beawesome as we watch a replay of bluethat\\'s Zeke just toying with it steppingon the tail air dropping ithe looks pretty confident out thereright now and I like it amazing thewater angle you see where he skips hehas a little bunny hop and air drop downthat massive waveand rides out successfully so Zeke\\'s hada couple of good rides too but we haveyet to see a goofy foot Champion here atthe Eddieif I\\'m if I\\'m recalling correctly all ofour winnershave been regular foot and I liked thewave earlier from Landon McNamaracharging on that big set Lucas chiankagetting a couple rides here that uhcould you know put some scores on theboard for him or that will put somescores on the board Jake Maki had acouple of bombs so we\\'ll see if this isthe year the goofy footer breaks throughI remember one year Navarro was reallyclosewe have some paddles herered and orange so we\\'re not going to mixthem up this time this is both MasonHill and the Condor Mason and orangePeter Mel and then tikonui or Tahitiantikonui Smith outon the uh the end there Mason doing theswitch stance two times but goes down onthe second re-switchtrying to go back to regular so we sawPeter Mel the deepest in the red jerseyfollowed by Mason Hallflows to him in the orange and then outup out in front with tikanui Smith ourTahitian competitor in Blackthat was an amazing wave it could have aroom for all three of them here we havetwo Riders up on the same time that\\'sKelly mamala in front in the yellowandI believe uh either Jamie I think that\\'sJamie O\\'Brien in the purple that is uhbehind keali and we\\'ll see if they\\'retrying to weave their way to the shortbreak oh almost there\\'s so much waterthat is uh in the form of cross chopsand backwash and sidewash and any kindof washalthough anybody has the skill to ridethrough that rough section it\\'d be JamieO\\'Brien have you seen that video of himthis year riding the river yeah yeah noyou\\'re right though I mean and just atestament of how rough it is right therea guy like Jamie cannot you know evengets bucked off his board therebut the shore break finale has beensomewhat of a a latter phenomenon of theEddie you didn\\'t see too much of that inthe early days of this eventas we watch the replays Isaiah yeahthat\\'s the shared wave between Mason andPete Milland uh tikanui on the shoulder therebeautiful ride great angle from theDronePete eventually gets bucked off by thewhitewash Mason doing his switch dancebut Pete ended up so close to Mason whenthey resurfaced I think Pete got draggedfor a little while there because he wasin the the meaty part of that waveas tikanui flies by and uh here\\'s a nicereplay of j-o-b and Kelly malmalasharing a waveunique right Rocky most surfcompetitions you\\'re not allowed to sharewaves that get an interference on butwhy may I be as long as you pick a cleanline where you\\'re not interfering withyour right competitor then there\\'s roomfor more than one yeah and then youspoke about the camaraderie and thebig Mutual understanding among thecompetitors that yes we\\'re here to winbut we\\'re also here to share thisamazing day of waves as we see[Applause]gets a

there\\'s a lot of wavesout there today so we\\'re blessed withsome beautiful surf as you can seeuh very consistent today Rocky andsomewhat the issue isn\\'t about havingenough waves it\\'s about getting onesthat you can make because there\\'s a lotof challenging ones out there yeah youknow the the high scores are definitelygoing to be the bigger waves as we watchmakani adrik our wahine competitor inthis heat number four local girl bornand raised right here on the North Shoregot the hugegot support from a huge water ActiveFamilyuh I grew up surfing at Haleiwa from ayoung age with Uncle Reggie adricklifeguarding there Hanalei adrik doingsome backhand carves that were just uhidyllic for me growing up as a younggoofy foot andthe whole adrik family very well Adeptin these North Shore Waters in makhaniright now is the one representing thatOhana and Waimea Bay yeah I mean to yourpoint earlier Rocky it\\'s not like uhwomen haven\\'t been surfing Waimea bigit\\'s just that they um this is the firstyear that we have uh competitors in theevent and to have six of them is reallyamazingand as mentioning earlier it is atradition of course in Old Hawaii thateveryone surf no matter your gender oryour age and so at the Eddie this yearwe\\'re seeing that representedso really cool to have uh in this heatmakani and that was a great ride thatshe had what are some of the stories ormaybe some of um maybe some olelo aboutHawaiians of course we all know theysurfed places like Waikiki and and youknow more manageable waves of course theboards and Equipment they\\'re using isabout as primitive as it gets but whatare some of the stories if there are ofHawaiians surfing bigger waves yeah sothe North Shore I mean this communityhere right here in Waimea was a verypopulated as a village and there are alot of people that lived here back inOld Hawaiian people surfed the NorthShore right and so we have stories of ofmany different Surfers in our levels ourour oral traditions and umso so yeah it\\'s not something that onlytook place in Waikiki but something thatSurfers did around the islands andincluding on the North Shore in old daysand even though he sent me the equipmentuh you use the word primitive but theriver pretty sophisticated differenttypes of shapes and different boardsjust like we have today in Old Hawaiiyou\\'ve had boards for riding big wavesfor riding small waves you had boardsthat you would lay on boards that you\\'dstand on boards you\\'d use just as ahandgun or some for paddling so therereally was it was really an elaborateand well-developed art and Sport here inHawaii calledparking lot not so much a highway rightnow but folks are stoked to be here Iknow that uheverybody has been abuzz about thisevent for the last couple of days andpaddling looking over the ledge that onejust was not going to let a man you sawall those bumps the wind you know from adistant it looks like a nice perfect waybut when you get those close-ups likeour great camera folks are getting youcan really see those chops and bumpsthat make it difficult sometimes you\\'redropping in eyes closed speaking ofdropping in makes this big wave lookhowever you can get through thatexplosion hold onawesome plot down right there get readyoh that last one kind of got him butthat way look at that it closed out thewhole Channel it was huge that was abomb that was gonna

whitewash and and foam fromezekiel\\'s wave but stilland those sometimes that takes a littlecredit away from the wave when you seeall that foam but the size of that waveeven though it was foamy was monstrousyeahyeah speaking of foamy we come up seewhere he is that\\'s still just a thicklayer of foam and sometimes it\\'s hard toget out of that so you can take a breatheven though the whitewash isn\\'t near youstill the foam from the residual fromthe previous wave still hard make itchallenging to get through right you\\'reabove the water the surface of the wateryou\\'re above the surface of

hegot injured on waslike a 10 foot first Reef Beast that hetook pretty much all on the shoulder Iwasn\\'t sure exactly what part of him gotinjured I knew that he got brought backto the beach by Hawaiian water Patrolbut it was one of those waves whereyou just cringe when you watch it liveand then you watch the replay and thenyou see what happened and it\\'s trulyamazing that he\\'s being able to be outhere competing typoand he thought about the short break andI\\'m glad that he didn\\'t uh for themoment just to maybe save it for thelast hurray but getting uh that close tothe shore break so

isto a lot of these Surfers and to all ofthese Surfers but especially those thatare paddling out here hindered andinjured and still making a go at it aswe watched Jamie Mitchellfree fall from the top of this waveabout four or five stories high andsurviving the white water and if there\\'sanybody that\\'s going to be able topaddle into these waves at Waimea Bay itis your 10-time Molokai to Oahu

Paige alms a three-time winnerover at jaws so Paige really beingum when we look at the women in thiscompetition she wouldn\\'t be the favoriteto finish uh the highest just be givenher history here 34 years oldoriginally fromVictoria British Columbia but moved toMaui years ago and took up the passionof Surfing and then led into a big waveriding page alms her partner Sean ordnisis also her shaper okay so closeconnection there with the the boardmaking that\\'s always great to have uhfirst-hand input of what kind of boardsyou\\'ll be riding and what you prefer andPaige like you said she has been doingthis for a long time only 34 but shestarted so young that we\\'ve seen hername among the top ranks of big waveSurfers for the last decade or Plusexplore.org Charlie Annenberg againstanding room only at wide mayor forthis Eddie and I got breaking news anduh with thisswell that we have coming right nowsometimes the heavens works with us andI do want to uh pay my respect andcondolences to the current familyearlier today we lost a y Maya and bigwave Pioneer Pat Curran father of TomI\\'m sure Pat\\'s smiling down on us andgiving us his Mana right now this couldbe you know in 2016 we had lost our goodfriend Brock little who was anincredible wine male Surfernow with the passing of Pat and 2016we\\'re calling that the Brock swell rightthis could very well be the pat Curranswell that we\\'re seeing here today atWaimea and uh thank you so much for Patand for all the currents but especiallyPat Curran with as being one of a truePioneer no leashwith all of the big heavyweights of thetime as we watch another heavyweight bigheavyweight drop right there it lookedlike it was Billy Kemper again there\\'snothing holding Billy back he is on firecommitted and as we said earlier justhow special this event is to all of ourcompetitorsbut the ones that are paddling out therewith uh with injuries and with you knownot a hundred percent still giving it ahundred and ten percent as we see blueand red carrying away yeah Grant swiggyBaker and Ramon Navarro Twiggy righthere continuing on Twiggy deeper on thatoneGrant Twiggy Baker a veteran of of thecrewum he\\'s out there riding his own modelhis Twiggy surfboards shaped by JeffBushman all right one of the North ShorePine uh Staples Staples yeah as far aswe look at big wave equipment JeffBushman has been doing it for decadesyeah and for non-hawaii Surferstraveling to Hawaii getting their winterQuivers he\\'s one of the first guys theycallyeah how important is it Rocky to haveyou knowa reliable big wave gunreliable is uh is the key word becauseyou know you can see these waves are notall about like high performance as wewatch Billy Kemper drop in on a bombdisappears in the uh the fork thebackground of that wave before as wewatch Grant Twiggy Baker in the blue andRamon Navarro are two uh non-hawaiiSurfers in this heatGrant out of South Africa and Ramon iskaipo mentioned earlier out of Chile socool to see them sharing a wave andbeing able to participate in thisEddie Invitational butreliability on a big wave gun isprobably at this size is more importantthan like performance or you know whatyou\\'re going to try to do on the wavebutas Isaiah said earlier these waves theseboards range from like 9 to 11 feet sothere\\'s quite a a space there to gosmaller and try to carve and maybe getyourself into a barrel like Brock didmany years ago right off the drop youknow that same year he had that stoneskipping Wipeout he also had a sickBarrel speaking of Brock and we have alull right here we do have a piece withBrock little talking about hisexperienceat Waimea and that exact wave you weretalking about we see the crowd righthere just waiting for the next set butwe did get a a great speaking piece tobroccoli let\\'s let\\'s listen to it rightnowas well as West and it was just standingup like straight up and then you knowthe winds were straight offshore andhard so you couldn\\'t really see whenyou\\'re taking offjust had to go and they\\'re perfect theywere they were from a perfect Directionyou could see it coming from a long wayout and everyone in my heat was justlike they they were Palling out and Iwas like I\\'m just gonna sit here and soI just sat there and waited and so Iturned around and I knew I was in a goodspot I knew everything was cool I got itand uh Bradshaw was like on the shoulderand I was like well I\\'m deeper so I\\'llgo and I think Bradshaw said I calledhim off but I I don\\'t remember calling Idon\\'t remember making any noise becauseif he I remember thinking actually nowthat I think about it that if Bradshawwants to go he can go in front of mebecause it\\'s such a big wave it\\'s such acool opportunity like to catch acloseout of my man and so then uhyou know I took off knowing you knowstood up and I was like I got thisit felt like there was so much watermoving that my board almost startedgoing backwards because it was such abig wave and I was sucking up so hardthat this my board didn\\'t want to and Ilove that board it rolled some greatwaves but it just didn\\'t like you knowkeep going it just wanted to go back andwanted to go up the face and all of asudden I was skipping and you couldn\\'tyou can\\'t penetrate like when giantwaves you just kind of skip and so I wasjust skipping and I remember looking atthe lip coming over I\\'m likeoh boy and then actually I remember likeI had like a little thing of you knowbeing being in my mom\\'s arms like youhave that kind of flash I was like ohI\\'m gonna die here but I got a breath sothen I you know gotta wrestle theirFalls blah blah blah blah ate itI think my leash came off but my boardpopped up right next to me and I didn\\'thave a leash on it was really weird andI don\\'t think there was jet skis then Igot to my board and put on my leash wentback out and like even the some of thecompetitors were looking at me likeyou knowyou gotta screw loose who knowshappywe love you Brock and Brock little uhtalking about his experience at Waimea agood friend of ours and uh we love themwe miss them and that was one of thosewaves that\\'s what makes the Eddie such amystical event in that things like thathappen and barriers are broken Brocklittle one of those Surfers breakingthose barriers riding his Gabe Gardensurfboard back then2016. Rocky was a rock swell and now wepay tribute to Pat Curran as well aWaimeaPioneer and I think Pat up in heaven ishelping us with these this wave energyhappening right now and the overallenergy in the Pacific and on Shore wellearlier you you spoke about you know thethe Heavenly alignment and what it takesto have an Eddy and the way this swellhas to line up and the timing the windseverything has to work almost to to aperfect tee to where today we startedwith very large waves huge wavesand Surfline is forecasting that we\\'regonna get this swell still coming in andpossibly increasing through theafternoon which I remember Eddie swellsthat had the potential but it\\'s gonnaPeak at 5 p.m right to 5 a.m and it\\'slike oh well we can\\'t surf overnight youknow until we bust out the stadiumlights but we\\'re far away from that butthe timing as we watch this live actionof I believe yellow out there that is Ithink it\\'s the shepherdson oh that\\'swhite excuse me that\\'s white

in the date of today ofJanuary 22nd 2023 running the Eddie forthe 10th time in uh in its existencesince 1984. and look at that back beerbehind the peak there it\\'s so nuts overthere it is it isthe reason that we\\'re doing this andthat\\'s who we\\'re celebrating The Lifeand Legacy of the Hawaiian water man butwhy Maya continues to perform 10thrunning of the Eddie yeah we gotdropping into this oneand unable to hang on that was TylerLaurent the young man from Mauiyeah a name that some of you might behearing for the first time and that\\'skind of a lot what we talked aboutearlier what the Eddie is known for toois highlighting these individuals thataren\\'t household pro-surfing names buton this scale in this category it\\'s adifferent side of Surfing yeah talaranactually a second generation Big WaveRider his dad Michelle moved over wasoriginally from France moved to Maui andone was one of the firstyou know kind of that pioneering crewover at jawsoh look at this wave Rocky oh this is amonster holy we got going stroking it tothis one really Billy camper in the loopoh my gosh I saw a splash which I thinkwas his Wipeout and I just got mankindchicken skinoh my goodness that wasthe biggest flavor of the day I think soI think so look at this one one moretakerLuke Shepard said with a giant drop thatpersonout running the Avalanche and heeventually gets eaten up butLuke shepardson doing it again that wasa closeout at the bank well another wayof coming into a third wave of the setthe bay is coming alive it\\'s what timeis it right now Hawaiian Time 11 33the swell could possibly get bigger I\\'veseen one Eddie canceled or not runbecause it was too big way back in 1998in this month of January I believe itwas uh in 18th or something like that itwas my senior year I skipped school Idon\\'t care I know that day but yeah itwas closing outmassive and too bigwe\\'re kind of right under that thresholdright now I feel like but it\\'sdefinitely contestable Eddy conditionsBilly Kemper getting the first bomb Lukeshepherdsontaking off on the second wave of thatset and if it\\'s just kind of observing alittle bit it looks like the first wavesof these big sets are the gnarliest bigdrops and then it kind of Smooths outand the second wave Luke was a it was abig wave but the drop didn\\'t look nearlyas hairy as Billy\\'s wave oh boy and aHawaiian water Patrol we got all thecamera angles right now Rocky we\\'ve gotwe have uh the Drone angles we have minicameras and I also want to thank uh thegood folks over at ohia farms which wehave a camera in their yard

andthen falls on top of the board that\\'sprobably one of the most hazardousthings you could do oh Mike Hall on thatwave and uh hazardous forLegends like Michael to be falling on ahardfiberglass Surfboard on a 20-foot waveHawaiian size that is uh a sketchyequation I hope he\\'s okayheading out there Ian it looks like inthe black Jersey that\\'s Landon McNamaraas we look forward to round number twohere at the Eddie again the Surferseight Surfer Heatstwo rounds surf Surfers are able tocatch four waves in each of those Heatsand at the end of the day their topthree wave scores will lead to theirtotal and that\\'s how we establish ourleaderboard and that\\'s I believe thatwas uhMichael and orange or page alms in pinkit\\'s a regular foot yeah it looks likeit was uh I think that\\'s Paigeso we got eyes onthe big wave charger out of Maui andPaige is okay yep water Patrol checkingon herand she\\'s showing some bravado yeah thatwas aincredibly committed drop andwe\\'ll watch the replay of Paige andyou know there\\'s a point where you\\'relike oh I got this and then it\\'s not ahalf a second later you\\'re underwatergoing oh I don\\'t got it and you saw howfast you got back on her board and waswas okay thankfully there were no wavesbehind that would have uhtrapped her in that little Impact Zonethere so she gets on the board says towater Patrol I\\'m okay and heads to thechannel and we saw that vision of waterPatrol giving the uhthe signal that she\\'s okay to the restof water Patrol what was that just a tapon the head right touching the head uhlike I\\'m okayit was a view andaquatic situations that\\'s how you sayyou\\'re okay and why in water Patrol withour Surfers photographers that areactually swimming out there that is oneof the more thanklessjobs I think in our industry of theseguys and girls that swim out there andthe tread water and get these epic shotslooking into the wave yeah we had alittle bit from a Surfline that weplayed earlier of Zack Doyle who in 2016uh swam the whole time oh there\\'s ourbrother right there Cliff bottello wegot you HWP and hfd\\'s finest he hey he\\'ssaving people whether on the firedepartment or Hawaiian water patrol allangles Captain safety Clifford Botellogreat to see him at the bay yeah it\\'spretty much all hands on deck forHawaiian water Patrol team they\\'resummoning you know they\\'re blowing thethe ohepu and the Kong shell across theisland calling them all to converge fromthe East West South and North Shore totake part in this water safety Endeavorso umbrella is like dusting off the dustof the PFD is trying to find it where\\'smy fin yeah oh whacking the finstogether getting the cobwebs out daddylong legs calling out the thethese guys are the best in the world ohmy goodness and that\\'s where and youknow and actually this group of of waterPatrol guys are the model in which watersafety nowglobally follows the model set byHawaiian water Patrol yeah it\\'s great tosee Hawaiians still innovating andinventing you know even modern day Imean Hawaiians get credited with thesport and active surfing and the Art ofSurfing as well uh you know otherinventions like the near shore fishponds were the first scene here inHawaii so continuing to innovate andinvent our Hawaiians at Hawaiian waterPatrol on the front lines of water andocean safety and as you said settingstandard globally and here\\'s yellowBilly Kemper back out there after agiant Wipeout camper again just findshis way in the scene and gets on thiswave he was on the beach like fourminutes ago and already back out onanother wave he was trying to get his uhvest deflated and here you hear therumble of the crowd anticipating thatShore Break phenomenon hurray that\\'sbeen of the Eddie the last few times[Applause]Billy wants the short break this one\\'sgreat good roll through we\\'ll see if itlike barrels at the very end but thisone has so much push behind it it couldjust roll throughand Billy feeling good about that onewhat an effort by Billy Kemper yeah Imean just to be in this event and outthere competing we talked about uh howhe was injured just uhabout a week ago and able to muster upthe courage and it says Mahalo to WaimeaMahalo to Eddie a true warrior standingthere embracing the moment and he\\'llhave another crack at it too you knowhe\\'s looking down uh he dedicated hisperformance here to his brother thelittle little e Eric Diaz and he knowsright there looking up at Heaven goingEric that\\'s for you man and I oh this isthe chicken style stuff right here man abig late drop for Billy disappears inthe background of that wavethat is in front that\\'s how huge thatsecond wave was and holds on you see theDrone tracking him thereanother disappearing act with the wavein front pumping hopping trying to getthis short break it seems like thisShore Break sand hasn\\'t lined up just asnicely as it would to provide those longextended barrel Closeouts that werewe\\'ve seen in the past here we\\'ve seen acouple of riders come into the shorebreak like this but it\\'s kind ofbreaking on top of itself with doublesup double ups and triple UPS as Baileyclaims that went to shore rightfully soso maybe later in the day as the sandmoves around we could see moreopportunity for those grand finale ofthe closeout Barrel because I feel likeit\\'s like the the luggage today with youdon\\'t make luggage without wheelsanymore right it\\'s hard to win the Eddiewithout getting a short break bombthat\\'s right and you know what that goesback to 2004 where Bruce irons took awin here at the Eddie and he was reallythe guy that established riding it allthe way into the shore correct and thenever since then that bar has been set offour rides here but it\\'s a dangerous barthat\\'s probably some of the mostdangerous part is right here we goum up and riding Ramon Navarrothe Chilean Sound the Horn so this isgoing to be the lastwavewell it\\'ll be maybe of the heat butthese guys aren\\'t going to stop surfingas the waves keep coming in they\\'re inthe spot you know whether or not theycan even hear the horn sometimes yeahwhen you\\'re way out there in thisoffshore wind and and kind of sidewhipping around it\\'s sometimes in thebay a little bit of an anomaly of wherethe wind\\'s gonna come from it has itsown little micro climate in WaimeaValley and in the bay so depending onwhat direction the wind is blowing andwhen the Surfers may hear the horn ornot the crowd definitely hears the hornand they hear each other cheering onthese big wave Surfers as they competein the Eddyyeah and you know what like you saidthey may hear the horn they may notthey\\'re going to keep on surfing here\\'sour Heat recap and uh a start of thisheat right here yeah Tyler Laurentcoming over from

Maki the goofyfoot Kai Lenny is out in red and LandonMcNamara in Black this is a stacked teeyeah it is you have two former winnershere at the event and then we have arider up here on a big one that\\'s Landonand the Avalanche eventually consumesLandon McNamara but he makes that bigbig dropyeah amazing Landon we saw in round onehad one of the higher wave scores of theday so I mean he\\'s he\\'s up there I thinkyou last we heard uh he was in thirdplace so he\\'ll want to like add to hisuh quiver of scores and that last onewas a good one yeahI\\'ll look at the leaderboard now I justhad a so we\\'re getting informationum and we will be relaying thatinformation to you so currentleaderboard now we haven\\'t got thetotals from this this heat that we seewalking up the beach but before thisheat we have kailani in first on theleaderboard Ezekiel Lao in second LandonMcNamara in thirdand when we look at the numbers thereIsaiah Landon\\'s low score is on a waveis a 13.5 so that\\'s what he wants tobetter at this point we take top threewaves are these two rounds Landon wantsto better that 13.5 to help himself onthat leaderboard okay well maybe explainwhat is the scale what is the highestnumber you get for a wave the highestnumber you can get for a wave is a 10Point ride but then again we add thethree judges scores together so um sothen you you can get up to a 30. yeahokayand we\\'ve seen a couple 30s actually aswe look at the leaderboardI think Landon has one asso Landon McNamara and remember this allthis information is coming purelythrough the coconut Wireless at themomentand Landon McNamara with a 30 as well asuh Ezekiel has a 30. here\\'s a replay ofthe wave of Landon his lastlate drop very steep behind that boilthere you can see so the wave explodesright behind himand he pulls a disappearing actsohere we go and this is going to be areally interesting heat as we can seeright there John John Florence as wellas Eli Olson good friends and Kai Lennyin his first Eddie Akai certainly aforce to be reckoned withevidently yeah and that\\'s just somequiet chat before the nextum set comes throughyeah amazing to have I mean this heatJohn John Florence and oh

timeflying over here you can see the Surfersrepositioning themselves they\\'re on thepaddle right now and being on thatpaddle why Isaiah check out this set ohthey\\'re positioning themselves you cansee they\\'re trying to figure out wherethe right spot is you want to be deepbut not too deep we have a few peopleaiming to catch this one John John wouldgo here he goes John John Florence dropsinto this one long wall in front ofFlorence negotiates that drop handedlylooks like this wave may just uh closeout the bay John John why does he makeit look so casual Isaiah he does and helook he was deeper than everyone he wasinside of everyone too late drop whatjust made it look so smooth and easy hehad a bottom turn on that one that manyof our competitors say you don\\'t reallysee them taking that line because it\\'sjust about survival but on that last oneJohn John managed to like bottom turn upthe face and ride out over to theshoulder I got my three p\\'s of SurfingIsaiah and it\\'s and it\\'s relevant intoany kind of Surfing but especially inbig wave surfing it\\'s paddleand then perform John John did all threeof those he paddled for that wave he puthimself into position so he could pickthat wave and then he performed justwith such a solid stance and great lineselection thereJohn John Florence of course two-timeWorld Champ uh the defending champ ofthis event that happened seven years agohere at Waimea Bay and he\\'s right backin and uhgreat form look at this wavebeautiful Drop wave barrels out behindhim he\\'s able to come around that whitewatergreat one for

we are commemoratingcommemorating of course Eddie Aikau atthis event and people would say thatthere was something too like Eddie Icall when he caught the waves he alsohad the ability to make that look easyand able to take off deep in behind thewave and really make him you know makeit look easy and that\\'s that\\'s one ofthe things that our our athletes areum you know that makes an athlete StandOut is their ability to make somethingreally challenging look pretty doableand so these guys make it look reallyeasy getting an update now on ourleaderboard we have Kai Lenny out infirstsecond right now Billy Kemper on thecurrent leaderboard Ezekiel Lao in thirdLandon McNamara in fourth and Lukeshepardson rounding out the top fivethat\\'s our current leaderboard as wekeep you updated and shake the coconuttrees for the coconut Wireless that\\'s acouple of minor birds for theirinformation and we finally get thatstuff to us and we relay it on to to youfolks watching thank you for joining useither on Surfline or locally on K Highand uh it has been an incredible daywe\\'re only halfway through the dayand bring you updated here at the Eddieand it looks like some peopleno better way to watch it well you knowwhat you get the replays if you watch ithere there you go but in person you getto smell and feel the Mana of the oceanoh there\\'s something we\\'re talkingearlier about the Mana of Waimea thevalley and the bay goes back over athousand years to uh it was run byKahuna Nui which is like these highpriests and the Bay has that kind ofAura of Mystique of of Mana this kind ofspiritual energy you have three heyothat are in Waimea and one of thelargest which is up above pupukea thelargest hail or uh kind of like atemple-like structure of of old Hawaiianculture that uh is there at the topthere they say that that heyo had thismystical ability to the the chief of thepriest that was residing there wouldcommunicate with the island of Kauai tothe nearby heyo on the on that islandwhether it\\'s through lighting of firesor through other kind of Supernaturalmeans uh this Hao has a lot of Mana toit and so does the beach here and theocean and we\\'re feeling a all today asthe audience is down there able totestify that the ocean has a lot of Manais it true through that hail and thoseCommunications through the Kahuna is howKamehameha got the news that heyis itthe the king at that time whenit was on on Kauai and and he said ohcool man you know we\\'re going to joinyou guys so we didn\\'t have that thatconquering of quiet you can\\'t you youread all the books I\\'m just going tovote by Legend right now yeah well theuh they\\'re kind of cool too is Heatherhevel is the name of his high priest ofkamehameha\\'s high priest that would makethese calls they would sometimes say youknow the they would read you know theelements uh and and interpret you knowwhat the signs or the uh the Hawaii Lonaare saying and and these these advisorswould say hey don\\'t go into battle atthis time go in the middle of the day ordon\\'t go to battle here and and so yeahso that was the job of the priests andhave a heva who by the way is theancestor or kupuna of the iCal family soreally interesting that communicationthat connection but yeah certainly thethe you\\'re right Kamehameha chose not togo to war against Kauai and they insteadmade a treaty with each other withoutWar Bloodshed yeah and then the folks atKauai join the rest of us gang over hereand uniting under one Hawaiian KingdomUnder Kamehameha is this correct correctyeah and so one of the final battlestook place on this island here we\\'relooking at Oahu and over toward the eastside where we have this battle at nuuanuoh that was a brutal one wasn\\'t it rightI mean Kamehameha brought his men up theshores in Honolulu pushing uh the theOahu Warriors to the edge of literallythe cliff on the precipice at nuwanutoday called the Pali lookout and that\\'swhere hundreds of Warriors fell to theirdeath rightkind of cool Jason Momoa is actuallyplaying there there\\'s an Apple TV seriescoming up where they\\'re telling thisstory of this battlesum and one of the Chiefs that actuallyJason Momoa is playing is is Kayana andKayana is the one of the chiefly figuresthat originally is with Kamehameha inhis uh in his on his army but then theyhave a kind of a falling out and in theand it climaxes at this battle of newone so it\\'s going to be a really epicSeries yeah that was a great story I washoping for Jason Momoa to ring me up aslike a role as a warrior but I guess Ididn\\'t make the the warrior cut in thatupcoming film but I\\'ll be watching itbut uhall right so getting you caught back upin the action here this is heat oneround number two it\\'s been pumping allday we\\'ve been listening to Surfline ourofficial forecaster for the Eddie theytold us that this swell would peek rightduring kind of midday into the afternoonand we started off with big ymail butnow Isaiah we\\'re seeingwe\\'re seeing some near closeout sets Iknow this one\\'s a Luke shepardson hadand Billy Kemper and that last Heatthose were maxing out so it\\'s excitingfor us to watch and I\\'m sure verynerve-wracking for our contestantsanother set coming through here andwe\\'ll see if we have any takers on thethird wave of the set the first two kindof roll under all of our competitors ourcompetitorspositioning themselves we got a paddlehereand ohyeahoh I can say is wow that was a a bigsteep drop to be had and it looked likewe had two Surfers paddling for that oneEli Olson and John John 4 and some oldfriends scratching it to this one JohnJohn says he wants it Eli right in frontof him and the two friends are gonnashare a wave at the baythat is just poetry in surfing WaimeaEli Olson John John Florence againmaking it look easyso fun to watch that and make againhaving these two friends they\\'re almostlike brothers sharing a wave together atWaimea very steep late drop that\\'s whatmakes it exciting the fact that JohnJohn was able to make that being deeperin the peak shows that probably thevalue will go a little bit more tobecause he was in the more critical partof the wave but man some big waves todaythere\\'s a famous image of Eddie ikawthat really put him on the map this wasin 1967 or 68 where he\\'s taking off on awave similar to some of these bigcloseout ways there\\'s John John Florenceand Eli Olsonlove these guys and uh you know they gotthey got their out there they\\'reum John John got his I\\'m sure it\\'s apiezel padlock he\\'s you know a guy who\\'sstuck with his shaper since whatever 10years of age oh one more look at thisIsaiah yeah I can see howdrops in the way under the sea level andthe two right there\\'s a water angle lookat how late he is turns the board rightas he\\'s dropping in so he doesn\\'t getthrown over the fallsbeautiful waveyou know I noticed he\\'s writing a redboard which is I don\\'t know if it\\'s anhomage to Eddie because Eddie was knownfor his red board and catching thesemassive waves in the 60s and 70s I usedto talk to some big Wave Riders who I\\'mjust fortunate to have in my life andfamily and some uncles and KimoHollinger who\\'s a North Shore PioneerHawaiian Big Wave Rider he told me healways liked the colored boardsespecially red boards and stuff becausea lot of those guys didn\\'t have leashesback then so you could see a red boardin this foamy White Water like this fareasier than you could see a white boardso the red board had like a also hadalmost a function to it by having thecolor on the board so you can find ityou know in a sea of whitecan you imagine I mean today we\\'re we\\'reblessed with um we have the water skithe jet ski to be there to rescue wehave inflatable suits we have leashesand so much technologyI mean when during Eddie\\'s time when hewas surfing the bay they didn\\'t evenhave leashes let alone any of thoseother things yeah and you know what wemade an announcement earlier and wewanted to say aloha oi and ourcondolences and prayers to the currentfamily Pat Curran are going to heaventoday an originalum Waimeaa surfer one of the Pioneers out hereand I think you know maybe some uh Pat\\'senergy and light is shining down on thisswellyeahRicky Grigg and Greg Knoll and youmentioned chemo Hollinger which isimportant to know that they were a mixof Hawaiian and Californian surferssurfing back in those times I mentionedearlierour condolence is also to the Aikaufamilywas passing recently and so we\\'rededicating this event also to Saulum who passed recently as wellyeah a lot of energy a lot of moneycoming into that\\'s what makes this souniqueas we see this is going to bethinking about thiswave here we go[Music][Applause][Music]we gotta ID them and we\\'ll get anotherangle on it so we can uh check it outbut here we go Isaiah we\\'re kicking itinto another gear here at Waimea anotherset coming through this frequency of thestep sets seem to be increasing as welloh my goodness watch that wave justunload and Barrel looked like it wasgonna spit on the end which is somethingyou\\'d see more at pipeline but Waimea isdelivering some powerful waves todaykailani repositioning as we fly up aboveand so maybe that was Kai on that thatlast wave that came through he looksenergized this is Jake Maki on theinside that\\'s the orange jersey for thegoofy foot teenager from the North Shorehaving to jump off his boardleash test time for Makithe young guysfrom the nearby here on the North Shoregraduated from Kahuku High SchoolJake\\'s one of those kids too that youknow the the legendary continuation ofBig Wave Riders born and bred on theNorth Shore is just this place you knowwe have people who who spend theirentire life trying to get here and theytrain here and they come here every yearbut the Homegrown Talent imagine someonelike a young Jake who\\'s just this hasbeen his backyard for as long as he\\'sknown right right yeahthere\\'s a replay of this oneand that is Jake\\'s wavedid a great job of re-emerging out ofthat incredible bombing wave that blewup right behind him right here boomdisappears re-emerges does the Houdiniact and that\\'ll be a great way for hisscore Line This is where we have the twoRiders up both of them up both of themdisappearyeah so that looks like it was AaronGold behindumone by Reno abalero remember kailani\\'son top of the leaderboard right now soa lot of things can change we\\'ve seenthat in every uh you know we\\'ve seenthat at every Eddy we can look back justto you know 2009 with the one of thelast waves of the event Greg Long tookthat leaderboard off of the hands ofKelly Slater Kelly wanted to make it twoKelly Slater winning in 2002. he wasleadingin that final heat in 2009 when GregLong caught that bomb at Waimea changedthe scene and put his name on notice tothe big wave community and really youknow started the career of Greg longwith that 2009 Eddie win yeah that wasamazing well we\\'re gonna have to go to acommercial right now to thank oursponsors and we appreciate all of oursponsors we\\'ll be right back with theconclusion of heat one round number twohere at the Eddie big wave

Dr Joshstoppa whose uh works at the Universityof Hawaii as a professor in Ocean andresource engineering program he studieshe studies of courseCoastal management but also the part ofthat process is understanding wave andclimate and welcome and thank you forjoining us Justin yeah thanks for havingme so being the expert as an engineerand uh with a PhD and we\\'ve we\\'recolleagues of sorts you know we\\'ve uhI\\'ve been able to join you in your classbefore and as a guest visitor and so butwe have you know you\\'re you\\'re here toum you\\'re an expertise is is also withunderstanding this swell and how totrack it so that\\'s really outside of myrealm as a historianumwe\\'re gonna see if there\\'s a wave riddenbut when we cut after this wave youcould maybe tell us a little bit more ofthe science behind this swell and whatwe\\'re seeing here at Waimea Bay todayyeah certainly here we goum well this this event in particular isnot uh so unique in its strength butwhat it it\\'s very unique with itsposition in proximity to Hawaii that\\'swhy it\\'s so big the waves are so bigtoday all right so oh my goodnessspeaking of big waves here we have arider up going backside riding thisbehind the curtains able to emergethrough the foamyou can do itsee if we can ride through this nextsection[Music]that is Landon McNamara who\\'s had acouple of really good ways one in fact aperfect score earlier in round one lookslike he\\'s gonna ride this one in throughthe inside[Music][Applause]so Justin in other words we um as we\\'rewatching Landon ride through on thisinside section through the shore breakthe swell is Big today not necessarilybecause the size of the storm but itsproximity to us here on the North Shoreyeah that\\'s correct it\\'s actually verysimilar to the 2002 event the stormtrack and the proximity and the strengthof the storm were very similarwhereas in 2016 you\\'d say the storm wasa lot biggerthat that storm was Stronger probablybut in further away okay but it had amuch more magnitude in the winds ininside the generation of the storm andthat created similar size waves as todaynow to our viewers maybe you couldexplain how is that we can predict whatis the science of knowing and predictingthese swells I know we have buoys and wehave other kind of forecasting but whatelse goes into the process of predictingyou know because we we almost ran theEddy last week and we decided not to andwhat is it that they\\'re watching forthat can predict these events beforethey actually take place well the theWorkhorse behind a lot of it ismathematical models that\\'s the onlything that really gives us forecasts andif we have a good wind forecast we canrun that through our mathematical modelsall right we\\'re going to watch thisreplay real quick this is of LandonMcNamaragets around that section rides throughthe foam and this is the one he takes itall the way to shorelook at the sides of that whitewashthat\\'s not something you\\'d normally wantto catch in whitewash but my goodnesshe\\'s doing his best to stay hanging onto that oneso sorry I interrupted you um tell us alittle bit moreso at this particular event I waswatching it about a week ago and theforecast was changing quite a bit whichusually means that there\\'s uncertaintyin in some part of the storm rather themagnitude of the track and then it kindof settled down about four days ago inthe in the forecast was consistent whatwas really good yesterday aboutum yesterday there was a satellite thatpassed over overhead of the storm andthat was 46 feet measured by a satellitealtimeter so that for me was like thefirst confirmation that the waves wereactually that bigwow yeah and I know um you know we havecompetitors that are we have to givethem advance notice and it\\'s not alwayseasy to do especially if and it seemedlike with this well as I was watching ittoo on Surfline that it seemed to changequite a bit and so it wasn\\'t as you\\'resaying until we had that imagery was ityesterday you said that just uhyesterday afternoon we got a direct hitwith an altimeter the previous days theykept missing the storm becauseum these these satellites don\\'t alwayscross overhead of the event of the peaksoum what do we what can we expect for theremainder of the day yeah so there\\'s abuoy Northwest of Kauai uh run by thenational data buoy Center 51001 and thatgives us about a four to five hourumlook into the future so the waves thereum this morning it was about at 7 30 itwas about 25 feet and that looks like itwas the biggest so far so we can expectthat in about an hour look I think thenthere might be a little bit of a lulland then it almost is consistent uhmaybe 24 feet again that\\'s offshore ofKauai so here you can expect maybecloser to that closeout we saw earlier Ithink we\\'ll see more waves like that inabout an hour and a halfyeah I mean what\\'s really nice we weretalking earlier during the breakum that it\\'s not just about the size ofthis wall but it\\'s the timing of itright because a swell will Peak andsometimes if it peaks in the middle ofthe night or early in the morning thenit doesn\\'t really offer a full day ofcompetition but it seems like this onehas the right timing with us and it\\'sperfect right it started this morning 7A.M and just got bigger throughout theday sothe other thing interesting with thiswell since it was so close to us here inHawaii there\\'s a Broadband range offrequencies or wave periods and this isuh means the waves will be reallyconsistent but sometimes it\\'s a littleShifty and I think you can see that withthe competitorsso so you\\'re saying because it\\'s closeand the shiftiness that it it may makeit more challenging to pick the rightone right and even on the buoy now youcan see some periods are about 21seconds and then it goes down even about16 seconds so it\\'s a pretty large rangeof uh wave periodsSo when you say Shifty what do you meanby thatumjust when these different wave periodsum interact with each other you can geta peak that starts moving a bit I thinkyou can see some of that on the biggestwaves herewell um do you have somebody a favoritethat you\\'re rooting for today in thisevent uh there it\\'s just great to watcheverybody I don\\'t have a favoriteall right well uh Justin a professorfrom the University of Hawaii at Manoauh got his PhD from there and Manoa aswell and thank you for joining usappreciate your time and being here withus in the booth yeah thank you alohapossible donations going through anincredible causethe memory the legend the inspiration ofthe Eddie I call alive well as you cansee our lineup is taking a little bit ofa break and our competitors are sittingin the lineup waiting for the rightplace to be as we heard our professorstoppa explain that sometimes the withthis interval uh swell that with a closestorm that the the peak can be a littleShifty in understanding where to sit issometimes not as certainon this board20 years agoone of her stretch out of Santa Cruz andagain dedicating this event of course toEddie ikaw and his legacy and surfingWaimea Bay and when he was 21 years oldcouplehe was that was where he got this bigswell and there\\'s a very famous photo ofhim taking off on one of these thatlooked like a closeout took off behindthe peak and you can see him with areally solid wide stance angling knifinginto the wave but you can see the peakin front of him that wavebasically made Eddie famous and this wasactually this one year he had quite theyear where he made it to the finals inthe Duke Invitational competitionwas known for surfing one of the biggestdays at the bay and getting the bestshot of that day and then that at theend of that year he got the call to bethe first lifeguard at Waimea Bay atthis beach yeah um and so in that oneyear really was like a big big year forhim and and since then and and then forthe next remainder of those few years hecontinued surfing in competition and uhand the bay became sort of his spotespecially as he was posted up here asthe Lifeguard the first lifeguard aswell at Waimea baby because it was sucha dangerous and treacherous place to bethat they wanted their most trustingindividuals to be there and he did hisjob incredibly they said under his watchnot one person lost their life yeahincredible and the celebration of TheLife and Legacy of Eddie Aikau and youtalk about treacherous Waimea and we\\'reseeing some of why man\\'s treachery rightnow as this set rolls through we sawthat first wave of the set no one ableto paddle into that one offshore winsanother big big waveraises to the Horizon big drop herelining this one upand it looks likehi Lennygetting exploded there on the bottom ifI\\'m correct he uh we lost some in thetrough for a second from our visionhere we gobig drop there for blue Aaron Goldand both Surfersunable to withstand the mountain ofwhite water that has encompassed thembut a great effort by both of thoseSurfersyeah kyleni as you mentioned earlier inround one he was the top of ourleaderboard and he\\'s still staying busyand active and as you said earlier in2009 when when umwhen Kelly Slater was in the leadthroughout most of the day it\\'s not overuntil all the Heats are done so um soKai still got some work to do to keep onthere we go here\\'s this angle of fromthe Drone Kai Lenny making that dropcomes around that explodes behind him heactually does reappear and afterwardswhere he loses his footing and hisbalance there\\'s a water angle of it lookat the size of that waveright here it explodes right behind himand still rides through that section soI think that hopefully will be a keeperfor him and put it into his cuethat was it was hey um I just want tosay something for all this coverage aseveryone\\'s who who can\\'t make it down tothe beach like these thousands of peoplefor those of you who are enjoying thison Surfline as well as K High I want tothank Eddie he and Sean Keely JustinAguilaruh writer YamamotoDave Yamagata and Stephen tercino someof the crew there at K2khon2 and K High uh for all of theirefforts that they\\'ve put in here and umHawaiian telecom for their support aswell thank you to the entire crew uhChristina and the crew over there atkhon2 for making all this possibleIsaiah this was a fire drill if you willwe don\\'t have you know a lot of a lot ofplanning that we\\'re able to do we hearthe swallows coming there\\'s speculationyou don\\'t know if it\\'s going to go andthen within the last I want to say36 to 48 hourseveryone\\'s had to scramble together tomake this show possibleand so Mahalo big mahalas to everybodyin their teams they\\'re getting and it\\'sthe you know the ocean right it\\'s younever know exactly what it\\'s going toturn out to we had Dr stoppo explainingthat they we didn\\'t know until lastnight precisely how powerful this stormwas or yesterday afternoon when asatellite flew right over the storm andwas able to confirm that they had45-foot waves coming and soit\\'s you never it\\'s very makes itchallenging in our sport to adjustbecause there\\'s like you said thereisn\\'t really that window that gives ussomething that we can always plan foryeah County Downing 1990 Eddie winner uhhad a famous quote to meet keone being amentor of mine where he saidI don\\'t get excited till it hits thebuoys that\\'s when I know it\\'s real whenthose buoys start moving those Noahbuoys that we have out in the Pacificthat move with the swells and give us aphysical reading of the swell then wecan really count on that as the actualswallow a lot of it is the science of Ithink you guys talked about the scienceof forecasting but a lot of that arecomputer models correct correct I\\'lltell you right yeah and even um I meanJustin was saying too it wasn\\'twe like you said you know the physicalmanifestation of the buoys we had thereadings this morning the buoys off ofKauai and once you get those readingsYou can predict with a lot more accuracyof exactly what time it Peaks and soforth and so he was saying that um we\\'regoing to see some more closeout setstoday and then it may take a little lulland then the afternoon we\\'re gonna seethat same amount of pulse of these bigswells coming to us yeah so we can seewith the buoy readings and I don\\'t itdepends on the swell angle but I believeit\\'s any it\\'s uh about 12 hours or soand even varying about the swell anglecorrect correct and so you can see whenthe buoys go down that\\'s when we have alittle breather in the swell but I guessthe buoys pop back up right rightyeah so so great to have Justin herefrom uh moneyline great to have you hereas well at Dr Isaiah walker uh Isaiah isa what you teach at BYU but what\\'s youractual subjects that you teach uh yeahso I\\'m a professor of History I got aPhD at UC Santa Barbaraand I\\'ve been a professor at BYU Hawaiiin the history department for the lastuh 16 17 years actuallyuh recently I\\'m I\\'m in administrationright now so my title right now is anacademic vice president at BYU Hawaiilike the shout out to all of our localkids to keep us on the map to all rightconsider BYU Hawaii as an option for youwe have a lot of great programs but uhyes I teach history world history that\\'sright Hawaiian history hey no no need togo Mainland right stay at home and Momand Dad the rent is free and go to BYUuh the best kept secret it\\'s a smallschoolum but uh I mean on the North Shore Icame here actually from Hilo group andHilo went to school by Hawaii as afreshman I was like brah like 15 minutesfrom VLAN[Laughter]yeah it\\'s it\\'s a great place and uh andwe celebrate that for sureaction in the water right here with alittle bitlittle bit of slips underneath ourcompetitorsin this first heat of round two againround robin format two rounds surf byeach of our Heats eight Surfer Heatsout of those and four waves maximumridden in each of the Heats so out ofthose eight waves you take your topthree wave scores add those together andthat\\'s how we get our leaderboard andthat\\'s how we\\'re gonna Crown a champdefending champJohn John Florence currently out in thewater in the yellow Jersey he wants totake that top spot again rightso if you\\'re interested in learning moreabout Duke Kahanamoku I recommend StuartHolmes Coleman wrote a book called Eddiewould goes but over 20 years ago did areally good job in that piecewaves of resistance it\\'s a book that Iauthored a few years back that talks abit about Hawaii and the North Shore andand Eddie Aiko as well so it\\'s reallygreat that we we have this Legacy ofsurfers and Hawaiian history and that\\'slike you\\'re saying earlier that this isone thing really cool and unique aboutthis particular event that it\\'s not justcelebrating the current wave action butthis Legacy and this tradition ofSurfing that\\'s taking place forthousands of years and for it to be hereat Waimea Bay and the valley of thisvery powerful and historicallysignificant place just adds to that Manayeah and and I\\'m and I\\'m feeling it andyou can see the Gathering there a lot ofpeople you may be uh messaging me dmingme I got you guys I\\'m trying to get youguys scores okay but this is Hawaiiankind and I\\'m waiting for an update fromthe beach and sometimes we gotta use thecoconut Wireless so I apologize for thatwe\\'re going to keep on updating you assoon as we get them they\\'ll be umverbally we\\'re gonna tell you the scoresand the leaderboard that is our capacityright here uh so uhexcuse me but we\\'re gonna get itmeans to waitso here we go uh as we see the orangecaution tape by our city and countylifeguards corralling off the peoplefrom the beach which is a reallyimportant aspect because North Shore ofOahu you can have these times wherethere\\'s nothing going on it looks safeit looks it looks almost inviting andthose are just lulls because before youknow it that flat ocean right thereturns intoan extremely dangerous place with waveheights on the face up to 40 50 feet butthe calm is what tricks people Isaiahright yeah and that\\'s what it keeps ourlifeguards really busyin fact we talk about Eddie ikaw as alifeguard and he had a philosophy oflike you\\'ve got to warn them before theyget into this situation it\\'s thepreemptive stuff that really makes adifference so he\\'s really good at likeencouraging people not to go near thewater line because it\\'ll sweep you offyour feet and then drag you out into theocean and there\\'s a very strong currentthere you can see as evidence with thatchop and all that water moving aroundthat our jet skis are trying to you knowmanage so you\\'re right it\\'s easy toassume that there\\'s a there\\'s a safetime because the waves are are taking abreak but they\\'re coming backon that series of close out sense theregoes the Hawaiian water Patrol had ashot of the tower there uh that\\'s anewer Tower and Eddie\\'s day there wasn\\'tair conditioning and yeah on that bigreinforced concrete pole as well pillarif you wouldscratching scratching go ohLandon McNamara taking a look at thatone wanted it badly just couldn\\'t get inand under the lipskis getting out of the way as a massiveset hits here without we talking abouthow it goes from calm to extreme giantdrops tippy toes making it to the bottomEli Olson ohand here two Riders to zero riders thatwas a bomb I\\'m thinking that was EliOlson and Jake Maki on that wavehere we go one moregiant Trump and I\\'m gonna make it to thebottom look like Alan gold on that onegoodness we\\'ll get that in the replay toget a closer up but that was action moresets coming lining up across the baythis one looks like it\\'s gonna take outthe entire lineupand likely connect to the left acrossthe bay Hawaiian water Patrol surveyingthe destruction on the inside and itlooks like umthat was white Eli Olson said he\\'s okayflying above here you can see therepositioning and what a scoop right nowgetting Eli on the back of that ski andout of the waymay have broken a leash we\\'ll see ifhe\\'s still got his board with him gotthe board nopeno that\\'s just the Escape escapingand with that throttle right there thatcould be keone Carolina one of thefastest ski driversin the worldhe likes the throttlelook at this big wayit\\'s amazing why may I be one thingthat\\'s really distinguishes this waveand the way that it breaks is there\\'spart of it right where the lip hitsusually a wave will explode and thenkind of shoot up and a little bit up butthat last one that we sawit shot out like 50 feet to the frontand when you\\'re riding a wave and likeyou got what seems like a fire hoseshooting you from behind it\\'s very hardto maintain your stance and posture lookat this drill right now by Hawaii waterPatrol they\\'re gonna have to zigzaginside of the surf line right nowbecause there\\'s no way I look like thechannelum if the channel has been taken out soyou can see these guys zigzagging herechecking on the competitorslooks like that\\'s going to be blue AaronGold he\\'s going to get on the sled I wastrying to do the pickupand just missing them sokeeping a watchful eye Hawaiian waterPatrol Eli Olson you can see him toothey\\'ve been taking quite a few wavesum with the rest of the set Isaiah yeahwe call that in surfing getting caughtinside where you\\'re unable to avoid thewave and there\\'s nothing you can do butjusttake it on the head and oftentimes hearof course maybe we\\'ll see this you ditchyour board go under it this close toshore soexplosion on the shore breakso also this that means these Surfershave had to take numerous waves on thehead and have been pushed near the shorebreak after basically getting explodedafter the takeoffokay so 10 secondsuh let\\'s check this out let\\'s check whatwhat the decision time isand that\\'s just uh coming in he\\'s okayall right good signthat\\'s Landon McNamarayeahwe took five or six monstrous waves onthe head and of course you have to holdyour breath each timeit looks like he also took his his leashoff look at this replay here Don JohnFlorence this is a Heat recapyeah that was John John Florence andJake Maki on that giant wave going allthe way across the baycheck this one out four three beautifulones looks like Greg Long yeah Greg longwith a nice drop staying in controlthereone more view this time of LandonMcNamara on the backhandbehind that boil and that white watchesengulfed himJohn John Florence making it look EasyAir dropping into this huge wave JohnJohn had a really good heat in thisround I got a couple of keeper scores soI think that\\'ll really help him on theleaderboard Here Comes Jake grabbingrail off to take offand trying to outrun that explosion doessoon this was Landon again caught a coupleof really good rides in this wave andthis heat excuse memade it around that onewe also saw him on that last Heat thatlast set oh and this is from way deepKai Lennyour current leader Kai Lenny looking

andyou know the alternate list you look atwho\\'s on that list it is an amazingcollection of big wave Surfers and we\\'vehad a couple of them get into this eventtoday uh due to uh injury we\\'ve alsoseen in the past uh especially with ourInternational Surfers sometimes hard tomake the logistics of getting here tothe Bay when it\\'s called on here we goit\\'s on for our Surfer in Orangethat looks like tile Shipman once againpossiblyorange pink or red pick a color andstick with it butlots of tents lots of people they\\'vebeen here since last night yesterdayeven and then just hey hoarding to thebeach this morning a lot of peoplecamping over there in the bushes on topof the cliff look at you guys No need noneed permit everybody just charged it ohbro it\\'s just the Eddie permit anythinggoes Eddie would go and anything goesthat\\'s pretty much the Mantra when it\\'sa day like today hey my Mantra is uhpleaseand pick up all of your rubbish pick upall of your Apollo everybody that\\'scoming down to the beach on the cliffsin the bushes whatevergather more trash than you even broughtso this is this is for next year becauseyou guys can\\'t hear us on the beach butyeah when do you guys come down ah whenyou watch it later because we\\'re gonnahave the uh replay yeah this evening onkhon2 uh we\\'re gonna have the replay sowhen you get back homeand you hear it yeah it just should beevery day you know what I mean we areone ocean that\\'s uh I\\'m wearing my hatbecause that\\'s my cause we are one oceanas we see the ocean folding over at thetakeoff Zone yeah we\\'ve yet to see agoofy foot winner at this Eddie in areallytrying to see if this is theBreakthrough year for a goofy foot we\\'veseen landed McNamara get some bombs he\\'suh checked in all of his scores and wesaw a pair of goofy Footers there Ithink that was Mark Healy and ColeRothman yep uh yep uh orit could have been Nick von Rupp too inthe white jersey but so do we do haveeight Surfers out there and it lookslike we have one two three of them beinggoofy foot score Rothman Mark Healy andNick von Rupp and just quickly back toyour mention I love the message ofpicking up your trash because you\\'re soright it is doesn\\'t matter whose it isit is all ours as we see Nick von Ruppin the white in front of KOA Rothmanwho\\'s in the blue so a pair of goofyfoots sharing a wave at Waimea on theirbackhand yeah so we talk about thejudging Rocky I would I would think thatCole is going to get the higher scoreout of the two he was deeper on the wavein a more critical section correct yesand that\\'salmost what you can guarantee uh if twoSurfers ride the wave equally the deeperSurfer will get a little notch or anudge in the score rightthat is the the more critical point ofthe wave to be in as you uh soeloquently mentioned just a minute agoand uh steep deep and underneath staysteep deep underneath and there is theriver over at White stay patient in thetraffic and it\\'s going to be one ofthose days only one way in actually twoways out yeah you go around the islandtwo ways but right you\\'re gonna end upin the same place because it\\'s an islandyeahyeah it\\'s going to be difficult to findyourself in a different location drivingaround in a circle but that highwayright there and that bridge is justgoing to be a choke point for the entireIsland todayand there you can see look at the thewater like you talked before coming fromthe ocean connecting to the river rightover that berm yeah you don\\'t want to bea river roller we\\'ve seen those beforeuh not expecting to get wet dry clotheson backpack aerating yeah yard salethere goes a cell phone and then uh butthat sand is also super deep so it\\'s notlike you can like fully Sprint throughit it\\'s uh one step and you\\'re like upto your knees so you gotta really planit well with your timing and Crossingthat very low-lying Point watching outfor those big sets washing over yeahRocky look at these big sets comingright now you know summertime we havethe the Fourth of July paddle racesputs on and the final thing after you doyour long paddle from Sunset or TurtleBay all the way who I miss you I gottarun up that soft sand in the healingyeah that\\'s the killer I\\'ve seen guys gofrom first place to last place thatwould be menot easy that run up the beach you can\\'tpaddle fast but you gotta run in the endwell here we go flying up above lots ofwhite water and still some jocking ofpositioning out in the lineup in thisheat two of round two no priority we weshould bring up as well is you know it\\'spositioning that gives you the right ofway and the kind of camaraderie uhgentleman gentlewoman type of uhpriority positioning kind of you knowback to the old school and the wayWaimea I think was intended to be surfedfrom the very beginning and I think allspots kind of in that way but we aretaking a step away from our conventionalcriteria and and format with thisnon-eliminationnon-priority and pretty muchnon-interference yeah but that\\'spriority every day even free surfing youknow if you\\'re deepwhy are you paddling on the shoulderjust knowing that the guys already gotit right you know because I know hey wewelcome everybody you might Pearl thoughwhen people come oh he\\'s got a checkthat\\'s it yeah I check but don\\'t butdon\\'t go but don\\'t go yeah just justbring some etiquette and some some youknow some of the Unwritten rules that wehave in surfing because we\\'ve had alarge surf audience join us in the lastI want to say decade and even more so inthe last couple of years exactly sowe\\'ll see a writerdropping into this one and who are wegonna go with thereI\\'ll let you go Rocky I\\'m good yeahthank youshipment on that one what do you think Ithought maybe Zeke loud[Music]I\\'ll pass it to you nowhere\\'s the ropewe\\'re having a good time we are EzekielEzekiel out 29 years old HawaiianKamehameha schools and the good news isRocky we\\'re gonna see Ezekiel Lau backon the championship tour we\\'ll kick offthe tour here we go yeah nice late dropthere for Zeke really casual lookingmade it look a little easier than itactually was survives thatgnarly white water that I heard Isaiahmention earlier shoots outwards into theflats which is kind of uh unique toWaimea Bay I feel like or some of theselarger waves or these big wave surfspots where the explosion doesn\\'t gohigh in the air as Zeke yeah he has asmoking not a super wide grin he wantsto get one of those grinners that hecaught earlier this morning of a hugelate drop I think he got a near perfectscore on that yeah ezekielauumriding his 10-0 Wade to Coral gun andthis is ezekiel\\'s first Eddie so youknow a really honor for any Surfer butespecially for Hawaiian Surfers you knowto get invited into this event yeah andand then the invitation happensand then it\\'s like you do the openingceremony but then it\\'s still likeanothernotch or another step to reach is itactually runs and so you can be invitedyears in a row without it running butthennow we\\'re we\\'re scratching the sevenyear Eddie itch with the 2023 happeningin ezekielau finally gets his chanceyeah and and it deserve it inviting intothe yetibeautiful afternoon and it\\'s we\\'ve beenvery fortunate that these offshore windshave continued to just stick around forus looks like Mason ho with his PatRawson gun getting ready for his go outfrom this angle he looks like a Menehunecompetitor like he\\'s just got thatyouthful like aura about him and whenhe\\'s looking that way and his long hairand stuff I was likewho who what\\'s the kid down thereholding Mason\\'s board for him yeahand making sure double not that buggeryeah right there you know like losethose on top national TVhey you got something to talk about isright you got to keep your shorts on andwhen everything\\'s going every differentdirection it is uh something to payattention to yeah if you\\'re not wearinga wetsuit you definitely want to keepthose buggers double knotted yeah and umaround your waist so Mason hoe gettingready for his next Heat number threecoming up Mason ho 34 years old butstill really you know that men who knowthat Grom in heart like yeah one of themost entertaining I\\'ve said it beforeI\\'ll say it again one of the mostentertaining Surfers in the entire worldwhen it just comes to like you want towatch someone surf so that\\'s going to beawesome Mason\\'s gonna Mason\\'s gonnaentertain you no matter what the wave iswhere it is he is a creative genius whenit comes to wave riding I love itnotice he has the quad fin on his gunyeah you know and I was curious aboutsome of the differences in choices forour Surfers uh we may even possiblystill have one of those OG traditionalSingle Fin Riders at the bay we haveEmily Erickson is out there on her uhRyan Carlson singlefin her Old Faithfulshe\\'s uh Emily\\'s out there so you seethe that\\'s the design change you gotsomeone handling out on a quad but yeahright now in a heat you have atraditional Single Fin gun out in thelineup right and and I think that\\'spart of the beauty of this event as wellas the equipmentchoices progressions but also Throwbacksand uh sticking to some traditionalstylesincorporating all of that in this singleevent is what makes this very specialso still on the standby for any kind ofuminformationthere\\'s a high washer right there that\\'sa toe ticklerreaching up the shoreline right thereover the bermyeah so next Heat we got Justine DupontCala Kenley Shane Dorian heartMalaLucas shanka Mason Hall and Peter Melhere we go live action and just gettinga little bit hitting some speed bumpstoward the edge that looked like thatwas uhPradaJamie O\\'Brien did I look like blackhe\\'s really digging in his Rail

surfyeah and maneuvering it and doing thosekinds of things on the backhand righthere looks like Mark Healy in the purpleso Healy with a big drop and a big bigbunch of white water behind him firmstands for Mark Healey and he is goingto maintain a finish right behind himdropping into this one getting to thebottom that\\'s going to be Nick von Ruppout of Portugalyeah Nick making it to thatopen face on the inside section thereand trying to stay close to the whitewater for a possible kind of length ofrideShore Break extension possibilitywe\\'ve seen that occur just a few timestodayand it really comes with being able todraw that right line and keep with ithe\\'s trying to pump and stay with itlooks like it\\'s going to fade out andnot let themall the way into the shore break thatprobably could be a blessing in disguiseyeah so I shook the coconut tree in thein the hey here\\'s our latestbring them all bring them home here wego here\\'s the latest in the leaderboardand we got a big change on top numberone right nowJohn John Florence has taken the lead onthe leaderboardKai Lenny currently in second placeLandon McNamara in third Billy Kemper infourth so John John he\\'s done surfingfor today will he hold on to that topposition well he\\'s our defending champlooking to be our first ever two-timeand back to back that would be quite thestory yeah sooh gosh he\\'s got a perfect wave a 30

yeahprettyall aroundtalented guy but definitely pushinglimits on all frontshere we go with Hawaiian water Patroltalk to us about this dance to getthrough the white water and the shorebreak oh man it is such a a delicate yetroughexistence to be operating a jet ski inthese conditionsnot only responsible for the lives ofothers but responsible for an expensivepiece of equipment and your own life ontop of it all it is uh and then you knowperforming Under Pressure there\\'s anaudience right you can\\'t deny thespectacle that is surrounding you whenyou look up and you\\'re on the ski inthere you look up to the every inch ofland is covered by a person what kind ofproblem can all this white water presentfor a jet ski when we talk about theimpeller and the propulsion of that wellit does have to uhsuck up the water to get propulsion andto get the into the impeller and the Jetandit only functions with water right itdoes not function well when it sucks upair or foam and that will cause it I\\'veheard the word cavity uh basically it\\'slike a misfire when you\\'re pulling thethrottle it\\'s revving but you\\'re notgoing anywhere and nothing\\'s happeningas far as Forward Motion so very trickyto operate in these conditions it\\'s verytricky to operate that high in the lipand air dropswowthat\\'s how shipment going for it youcould see him getting hung up in the lipby the offshore wind and unable to getthe inertia that it would take to getdown that wave faceyou know I\\'m not sure if you knowsometimes you stop paddling too soon orI heardum Twiggy explained sometimes thatthere\\'s a little current actuallypulling up the face or some water movingagainst you with the wind you pair thattogether that\\'s just not auh positive equation for your big waveendeavoryeah we had a talk and we had a piecewith Brock little talking about hiscloseout wave that he caught at the Bayof legendary wave and how he couldn\\'tget down to face at all because it wasso much water moving up the face here\\'sa replay he\\'s trying to go like down anup escalator right therethere\\'s a water angle of tile juststroking into it gets to his feet andthen is a little hung up just thatlittle separation of the board from thewave creates that slippage off the frontyou saw his front foot kind of slidealmost did the splits as he was goinginto the water so it was uhdo you want to elevate a little bitscary for a moment there I\\'m sure fortile but he looks to be up and okay withbombs out the back oh my here we go youcan see him coming and the guys outthere in the lineup they can see himcoming the crowd feels it on the beachthey\\'re starting to cheeroh this is a big set Rocky oh manis it gonna take out the entire lineuppossibly is anyone going to spin on thiswave who\\'s in positionjet ski trails over the shoulders ofthese waves tells you they\\'re on themove as welloh my ohoh markoh that was Mark Healy just floating andflutteringmy goodness on a 50-foot face oh geezone more let\\'s see if we got any takershere there\\'s just like too much waterdrawing I don\\'t know if that\\'s one\\'seven possible riding right I know likeyou need likego go gadget arms to be able to get intothat like with you know orangutan armsor something like it\\'s just almostimpossible to paddle in from where thoseSurfers were how deep they were andsometimes I almost feel like on a on areal concave cupped out Giant Wave likethat it turns to physics in a wayit\\'s you know the inertia it takes toactually catch it and then stand up andget down the wave face it\\'smathematically not possible at time attimes paper yeah I\\'m not Professor butum yeah that\\'s what you\\'re saying youknowand and some of these big boards wetalked about a little earlier withIsaiah is likeeven though the wave is huge it stillhas a hard time fitting a 10 foot boardinto the Contour right of some of thesewaves so you factor in so many variablesof what can go wrong and uh just likethe Eddie needs everything to go rightto have this event the surfer iscatching these waves need just as muchto go right to be able to make it downthe face isn\\'t it true you have to befor far enough in so that you can catchthe wave but you have to start paddlingsoon enough to get enough of that wholespeed to even catch it and you can justsee Mark Healey he wanted itjust could not and I think at a certainpoint he was like okay I have a chanceto get out of this unscathed right andI\\'m gonna pull the pull the you know theemergency brake right now look at thisVision oh my gosh that\\'s a monsteroh that was like almost if he would havekept going it would have looked likeBrock goofy foot yeah potentially thatone took out the bay yeah you knowcorner to corner at Waimea and that is aGiant Wavesee our next Heat getting somecocoa some help out to the lineup andpreparing for their second attemptthat\\'ll be heat three that\\'s on DeckHeat number twoof round two right now is the heat thatwe\\'re watching live and look at all ofit looks like a giant unsavory hot tublook at the lines on the horizon andmore swells hitting the peak here atWaimeaChad look at the water Patrol oh they\\'reon the Move starting to gun it yeah theyrecognize where they\\'re at as well andlook on out to the Horizon this droneview shows you the mountains of waterthat are approaching the lineup rightnow oh dropping into this one I thinkthat\\'s Mark Healey againoh going for it swallowed oh my goshwhat a chargeran incredible free diver Rocky and Ithink he\\'s freediving right now as wespeak it\\'s expensive right now not sofree he\\'s paying some pricebut yeah he is uh got back to thesurface sohe\\'s one of those guys that yeah he candive deep 80 feet with on one breathmaybe plus I\\'m not gonna you knowshortchange him at all but he goes superdeep and he has to use all of it rightthere and what about the situation he\\'sin right now taking the rest on the headoh here we go look at this the waterPatrol better hurry guys there we gothey got itso impressive another big way ofapproaching here our safety teamHawaiian water Patrol I can\\'t talk aboutit enough just so impressive on howquick the pickups are right now in thesehazardous giant conditions yeah and thecommunication too because we\\'ve got likesix or seven rescue skis out theretrying to uh you know triage and see whoneeds what when and where right you knowit\\'s it\\'s the big area but it gets smallwhen you put more skis in the water andyou know the fear and the uhresult of collision is real so theseguys got to be ultra aware that thenon-verbal communication as well justknowing what to do and knowing eachother so well is a big part of itreplay time oh boy here\\'s Mark Healy ona bomb he was gonna do this on the wavebefore it gets a second chance and makesit all worth it huge drop that is goingto get some attention from our judges uhthat is that\\'sthat\\'s what it\\'s all about you knowexecuting uh those steep drops on giantwaves KK on the paddle out Kayla Kenleythere she goes with her body harnessleash thattechnique to protect the lower Limbs andavoid the possibility of having yourleash around your ankle being ripped oneway or the other and doing

it\\'s sofar inside it\\'s stillquadruple or bigger over his head and hewanted to do the short break run but hedidn\\'tconvert it thereoh but impressive just to make that dropto survive the giant white water and nowdecision time for car let\\'s see if he\\'sgonna make it on this wavelooks like he\\'s got ityeah he\\'s kind of right outside theshore break where it\\'s just breakingover about four feet of water it\\'s allsand but it\\'s still super superdangerous and look at our Hawaiian waterPatrol position themselves right therein the seam oh boy yeah Gotta Go GottaGothis is the Waimea

he\\'s very okay he gotdragged about three quarters of afootball fieldunderwater wowMark Healey so impressive with hissurfing his steady stance as well asjust pure courage on that wave yeah andsurvival after that I meanthe drop was so so long it took him likeI don\\'t know how many seconds to get tothe bottom I thought for sure he was agoner in that explosion it happened onhim the wave happened to him the wavebeforebut he made the adjustmentfor this one and survived that that\\'sgoing to be another could be a bignumber good attention from our judgesand uh we\\'ll see where that leaves himwhen this is all said and done for Heatnumber two still got three moreaction-packed Heats to gobut we saw some you know big numbersperfect scores getting thrown down Imean when you look at the criteria ofwhat the Eddie is all about I feel thatthat needs to go there yeah and we\\'veseen the scores on the board already sokind of comparing those waves to MarkHealey\\'s wave just now it is right onpar in parallelhappy to be parallel on the beach rightnow with his board laying therelet\\'s check out this replay let\\'s startfirst heretile tile shipment yeah he survivedsurvives the explosion kind of rode highon that one escaped it a little bitgave a little uhShaka to water Patrol as he rolled byand then was trying to negotiate thisinside section possibly for a shorebreak finale the infamous Waimea ShoreBreak Eddie finale but got a littletripped up here or uh kind of makes hisfinal bid and wave to the crowd andlazily just falls off the back and saysthank you Eddie thank you Lord and colaRothman that was a beast Yeah CarlRothman with a big big drop and justsolid in his approach here able to makethat connection look at him from thewater core Rothman oh on the tippy toespulling it off yeah justnearly falling toe side Mark Healey yousaw the fluttering airdrop of that andthen being able to hold on through thisAvalanche of white water wassheer willcommitment a lot of uh training going ininto that survival right there but lookhow much water surrounds him he justdisappears in that white water comesback out those nuts looking at him rightnow he wants some more and howintimidating is this wave coming at himand Healy just decides to point it thisis from the Haleiwa side of the bay theleft coming across andwow that was so so gnarly Mark Healyyeah let\\'s give it up to Mark Healyright now we\\'re going to give him a clapand you know it\\'s pretty cool all theSurferswhen they get to shore they have to turnaround and kind of have that moment ofreflection of appreciation and you justwonder what\\'s going through eachindividual\\'s head at the at the momentyeah but I feel like a lot of it is justyou know that admiration of what whatjust happened and imagine the adrenalineright now that\\'s flowing through MarkHealey\\'s body as he\\'s standing on thesand right now it is it has to be justredlining yeah before the North ShoreSurfer oh here we got more it\\'s not overyet yeah we got yellow out the back thatis uh Nathan Fletcher he was the deeperSurfer I believe maybe red Ezekiel I wasin frontuh I\\'m still trying to catch my breathand I have

we\\'re going to catch upon that happened during our break Isaiahyeah look at the size of these waves itseems like the waves took a break for afew minutes but it\\'s right back onyeahfrom Big Islandand I mean yeah during the break I wasjust I meanI hear all the eruption of the Applauseand just the excitement of it the energyto have those waves like closing out Isaw it Zeke took a heavy Wipeout yeahgot right right back out there caughtanother good one but Mark healy\\'s waveman the way that wave exploded behindhim and he disappeared and then he cameout and uh what that how\\'s that insidesection that took him out that wasincredible that left that was comingfrom the Haleiwa side I don\\'t know ifI\\'ve ever seen I can\\'t remember the lasttime I\\'ve seen that inside sectionlooking that huge and daunting it almostlooked as big as the peak was exactlyyeah that was kind of freaky of like youknow how far in he\\'s riding and thenwhen that wave connects over from thatside it is not anywhere near the mainPeak but it was as tall as some of thebiggest waves out there that wasimpressiveso boy it\\'s been an exciting day we\\'veseen so many good waves I really wasn\\'tup it has been like you know like ashocker right like every heat has beenaction which is I know that\\'s reallyimportant because it this competitionthe way the format works if you do havea heat that seems to be you know moreconsistent than another then it doesn\\'tseem like it\\'s as Fair of a shot or thatthe ocean is choosing its favorite heatexactly but today it doesn\\'t seem thatway it seems like today like every heathas these setsum through Closeouts today she\\'s notdiscriminating right equal opportunityfor all and there has been like you saidconsistent conditions there maybe was acouple of minutes here and there\\'sNathan Fletcher doing uh some PR workdown on the beach saying how\\'s it to thesurf fans that are all so excited andKyle Shipman right there one of our verygood born and raised North ShoreBrothers talking to Nathan for a momentbut what an opportunity for all of thesebig Wave Riders we have two wahines inthis heat Justine DuPont from FranceKayla Kennelly from Kauai they\\'re thetwo representing our joaquinas Surfersout here we have at least one in everyHeat this heat three we have two of themwe\\'ve got theveteranShane Dorian from the Big

have arider upthat\\'s keola in the blueChannelgetting a wave here in round two Heatnumber three of the Eddie big waveInvitationalout and look out the back Isaiah you seesome largesets approachingon our screen you can see it the littleContours and difference in the color ofthe water to indicate the size the swellit\\'s hard to tell how big though fromhere and nothing like being on the beachbut for those of you who wanted to stayaway from all of the traffic ornot here in Hawaii it couldn\\'t be hereon the beach we appreciate you guystuning in on screenevery time you look I was like ohthere\\'s another set rightone of the most consistent big waveswells I believe that we\\'ve seen as faras a number of waves per each heat hasbeen and as you said earlier therehasn\\'t really been uh off heat or a heatwith it extended lulls it\\'s been fairlyconsistent for everybody across theboard our uh Professor engineer Justinstilpa wasn\\'t here explaining to usit has to do with the fact that thestorm is close to us okay and so thewave period is uh it\\'s a little closerbut it\\'s also perfect offshore I mean hesaid it also contributes to a little bitof shiftiness to the peak oh my goodnessoh and somebody in OrangeLucas chianka justsending through himself sent it over theledgewe just got a glimpse of him from thatlive angle looking from kind of you knowthe the back of the wave or the the backdoor kind of lookingtowards the right-hander but he wasthere and then he wasn\\'t there but youcan only imagine what he went throughbecause he looked like he was in a veryhard and precarious position rightfrom that angle if he ended up gettinginto it or if it blew him off the backbut he\\'s got the ski assist soapparently he definitely didget that one on the headoh he\\'s the one of red this was MasonJosue oh actually I think that might beJustine Dupont she\\'s in the pink oh myGod so that was a great way amazing anduh back to back our wahine SurfersJustine and kealaable to hang on and thread the needleright there walk the tightrope as we seechianka I think he actually went andprobably went over you so I was boredfor a glimpse right there if there\\'sanother angle we could look at that waveof Lucas and just admire the commitmentthe charging[Music]because yeah I mean he had to becommitted that was crazythanks for correcting Justine Dupont didyou see that massive wave that shecaught at Cortez Bank last week oh mygosh I like how do you evenget the you know get your head in thatzone to go on a wave like that and forour our viewers who aren\\'t aware umCortez bank is this wave that\\'s likeover 100 miles off of San Diego it\\'sit\\'s not even a land mass it\\'s a reefthat\\'s just in the middle of the oceanright and uh very rare and hard to getbecause mainly because of the windconditions have to be just right soanyway but Justine Dupont actually fromthat session her wave was the best oneat least from my opinion of thediscussion from what the footage I\\'veseen so farmassive wave so uh Justine on her lastwave I apologize the color mix up butthat was definitely just seen chargingamazing waves here at Waimea Bay thereyou see the lineup of jerseysour Surfers are wearing so we\\'re prettymuch running you know with eight Surferswhere are all the colors of the rainbowrepresented right and everything inbetween uh if you think of new colorslet us know but we\\'re trying to pick thebest colors that have the mostdistinction and uh identificationability because our red and our pink andour orange have sometimes been a littleuh cross-colored or uh you knowcross-pollinated when we\\'re calling theshots on the screen here and thenum you know different lighting and andbrightness and and uh Darkness on thethe screen has made it a little therethere you see him right in a row likewow you know if they\\'re on a wave RidingIn Motion it\\'s a little tricky but uh wewant to uh thank you all for tuning inand bearing with us on on that littleside of things but it\\'s been quite theentertaining day we\\'re in the afternoonstretch here Heat number three 50-minuteHeats for this second round and we\\'veseen kale imamala get a couple get a onereally good wave in the beginningthen it was our wahine going back toback Justine and keala and looks likepossibly another opportunity out theback Isaiah yeah more lines off the backthank goodness the jet skis are there tohelp because there\\'s you know on anormal day when you when you wouldn\\'thave the jet ski assist getting throughall that white water especially on thosecloseout sets would be you know verydifficultto the Horizon if there\\'s anythingthat\\'s going to be ridden here in thisset yeah I don\\'t know but I see a lot ofactivity just on the outside so we\\'llsee if our Surfers start to move inposition a couple of surfers paddlingfor this one one of them gets itdrone is honing in onlooks like our Surfer in red Mason holdwith the switch stance little one footWonder right there we\\'ve seen a lot ofswitch stands today yeah yeah we saw KaiLenny hi Lenny uh Mason do it anothertime right I thinkJake Makiawhich is you know something that wasreally big actually during Eddie IKyle\\'s time yeah in the 70s 60swould always be front side yeah I callit by Statue they\\'re able to go eitherway which is really cool and they\\'llalways be front side you\\'re right masonhall with the grinand the smilealways a character that guy is just theEntertainer has some of the best uhclips of him surfing on his on his onhis site on YouTube yeahum also just came up with adocumentary film called through thedoggy door so he\\'s very active stayingbusy and here he is on this one yeahbeautifulnegotiation of that wave kind of playingwith it a little bit then of coursedoing the switch dance and gets the rugpulled out for Monday a little bityeah so honoring Eddie ikaw and hismemory and his legacy and all theamazing accomplishmentswhen when Eddie was uh surfing the NorthShore when he first started he was 16years old and talked about by the timehe was he was 20 he became the firstlifeguard on the North Shore and thenfor the next 10 years he just reallyhoned in his skills on surfing the NorthShore and his big goal was to to win theDuke Invitational which was the onereally premier professional surfingcompetition on the North Shorehe would usually make the finals eachyear final final but would get secondplace or third place uh it wasn\\'t until1977 when he was 30 years old why heended up winning that event at SunsetBeach and it was kind of a crowningmovement moment a chronic achievement inhis life interestingly his youngerbrother Clyde I call who by the way wonthis event at 1986 right won the DukeInvitational 1973 before 84 Eddie soaccomplished Surfers you know even inthis event today we\\'ve seen generationswith Mason ho his dad is in this eventum we\\'ve we\\'ve seen a lot of a lot offamily Legacy in this eventum and so kind of cool that goes backeven to Eddie\\'s story is hisrelationship with his brother andsurfing these events and super cool tobe a part of that tradition and thatwe\\'re here still on the North Shorecelebratingso much talent and so much Legacy hereat Windmill yeah all these years laterwe\\'re talking you knowfrom the timeline you just describedcompeting at the Duke you know at SunsetBeach you know we\\'re talking uhdecades upon decadesand the fact that it is still so muchalive and well almost like he\\'s stillhere and that type of respect and thattype of feeling that we\\'re doing thisall these years later and uh the Manathe vibe the power the the being is suchis still so strongyeah a lot of that is because not onlywas he a great Surfer and a lifeguardthat saved many people\\'s lives but alsohis commitment to his community andsacrificing literally his life to savethe crew on the Hokulea voyaging canoeit was in 1978 it was on a voyage toTahitithe canoe double canoe which was acouple it\\'s a it\\'s a it\\'s a modern dayversion of a traditional sailing vesselthat Hawaiians and Polynesians sailed onfor thousands of years before1975-76 they went on their maiden voyageto Tahiti the purpose of the voyage wasto restore the the Mana and the prideand the knowledge that these Hawaiianswere great Navigators from ancient timesand so Eddie after he wins theInvitational signs up for this thesevoyagesand goes on the second voyage to Tahitiwhere the canoe encounters some troubledwaters right takes on some watereventually the canoe capsizes he has asurfboard with him on the canoe tries topaddle for safety but the nearest Islandwas more than 40 miles away wowhe\\'s never seen again but thatcommitment to his community commitmentto his culture commitment to the peoplethat were on that canoefortunately there was an airplane thatflew over right an inner Island planeand saw the canoe and back thenum here we are supposed to celebratingbut you know the thewherewithal to to save his to risk hislife to save his canoe mates and hisfellow peoplesum just shows the kind of person and thecommitment that he had and so that\\'sanotheryou know layer to his legacy and thereasons why we celebrate him eventhrough this event yeah in the spirit ofthat uh camaraderie the spirit of thatselflessnessis amazingwhat transcends the competition itselfand the surfing in the big waves isEddie\\'s Legacy and the way that you knowhe cared and uh his actions spokevolumes of how much he cared for otherpeople right A lot of times peoplethere\\'s you know Erica and Duke of veryfamous people in Hawaiilived for you know to a very rape agelike he died in 1968 he was in his 70sYeah Eddie Aikau passed away at least 31years old apparently this is the 55thanniversary today of Duke passing rightuh so on point right there he you knowhad a uh fairly long and uh fruitfullife and Eddie unfortunately you knowcut shorter than we all would have likedbut it feels somewhat faded and anddestined yes when you even think aboutthe crew of the Hokuleaended up being saved if he would havestayed he could have also been saved butyou couldn\\'t explain that to a guy likeEddie in that situation of no I\\'m gonnago and I\\'m gonna find help and I\\'m gonnado what I can and what I know how to doto give us our best shot of survival andthat was in the time of that momentthat\\'s what he was feeling and he wentoff and like you said was never seenagainand encapsulate that Spirit that\\'s wherethat slogan Eddie would go and that\\'swhat we talk about and maybe weperpetuate that here at this event andthese Surfers are willing to take thatsame risk in that charge to go when thewaves are massive in this uh event andsoum also trying to emulate I Supply ourour you know athletes are trying toemulate that Warrior spirit that Eddiebrought to uh to us in the surfingCommunity here we go look at that hugeLake Drive gosh two big late drops onedoes not surviveand that is Lucas chianka in the orangeputting it down wow that was acourageous attempt does a backflip incelebration very appropriate our Surferwho was in the front I believethat could have been red Mason hoe thatwas such a heavy wave it was so steep itwas so steep yep and for him for the twoof them right there together and manthat was a great way from Lucas jonkeror Surfer from Brazilthere\\'s Lucas paddling back outlove the energy the back flip just againthat monari feel and especially catchinga wave of that manic magnitude and theenergy and the power that you\\'re feelingas you\\'re riding that wave yeah theexhilaration of the drop right there itlooks like he\\'s a goner and I believethat is Mason Hall justfree falling out of the sky right nextto Lucas chianka and Lucas unfazed bythe free-falling Mason hoe just does agreat job making it through thatend section there we go Lucas and thenMason oh my gosh we\\'ll hope Mason\\'s okayhereallyfell hard right there he is paddlingnext toLucas and looks to bedoing pretty well back on his board atleast moving and paddling here we goanother big set oh my goodness off theback[Music]all rightall rightall right those boards are so big everytime you see a surfer try to you knowpump it and turn it it is like you knowyou\\'re riding on ahugeloss that is like you know you\\'re alumberjack all of a sudden trying tocarve this thing down the Chute andKelly he kicks out before he hits theshore break we\\'ve seen a couple ofsurfers attempting for thatOutside Inside connectionslike Shadow from Kona yep that wave wasbarreling right behind him as he wastaking offincredible waveour competitors dealing with thatmountainous whitewashersthis must be the tide and the swell allthe waves are starting to kind of closeon that inside section where you have tomake a decision am I going to keepriding and make it a long paddle backoutor am I going to kick out here and uhkind of quit while I\\'m ahead right and Ithink they also saw in that last Heatwhen Mark Healey straightened out whathow that worked out for him so maybethey\\'re learning from that example yeahthat connecting swell coming from theHaleiwa side of the Bay is just rightnow being a little bit of a a nuisanceand uh stopping our Surfers from beingable to continue to the inside as wewatch keali imamala on a nice wavesurvived that white water and him tookind of looking down the line and thensees this section thought about thecutback a little bit sees the sectioncoming up ahead and says I\\'m gonna stophere although kicking out right therewas also kind of precariously the wavesright behind the bigger ones hopefullyhe made it over those but we have liveaction so much foam and whitewashingthat channelbarreling sets on the outsidesee if there\\'sanother Surfer out there in the lineupand get these next onesso ever ever since that incident 1978umrelief you know that it was kind of apivotal moment because it was a matterof like do we continue doing this Voyageor not hokuleo was basically swamped anduh that was another thing that theydecided just like we\\'re seeing heretoday is just to send it they decided togo for it continue the voyaging and whenthey did it this time Eddie\\'s spirit issort of a part of the Polynesianvoyaging society\\'s Mission and purposeand voyages today they implemented a lotof changes from so now you know you haveto have an escort vote with you they\\'veimplemented a lot of safety precautionsand in many ways in the name of Eddie Icall and for his sacrifice to make surethat it wasn\\'t in vain and um and I knowwhat Thompson who\\'s the captain ofHokulea one of the captains he explainedreally nicely in a actually this reallycool documentary uh ESPN did a 30 for 30series yes and if you haven\\'t seen itcheck that out I think it\\'s on Disneyplus but in that filmumexplains like Eddie had to to go existthe idea of happy birthday which is avessel that carried the culture thepride of the culture during a veryimportant time in Hawaii\\'s history knownas the Hawaiian Renaissance whenHawaiian culture and language and it wason the rise again so it was like kind ofessential that the canoe survivedbecause it was carrying with it thespirit and the culture of Hawaii youknow symbolically and so I know Thompsonexplains in this in this film he saysyou know I think the thought of nothaving that was too much to bear forEddie and here we have Kali mamala\\'swave replayedyeah surviving that reallythrustingrash of the bottom of the wave and Iheard you mention earlier as we watchedshano also big wave Legendand one more time here for our Surfer inyellow that is heart I heard youmentioned the uniqueness of the wave andsome of these big waves where they don\\'tcrash and reverberate upwards right itis outwards yeah laterally in front andthat just really creates Havoc for anysurfer trying to maintain balanceand getting a blast from behind andbeing able to hold on is really trickyand that\\'s what adds to the excitementyou know usually we\\'re watching eventsat pipeline for example we say that thewow factors when they\\'re in the barreland it does you can\\'t tell if they\\'recoming right or not even though wehaven\\'t seen many barrels or any barrelsyet today uh still that being coveredcompletely by that explosion of a40-foot wave whitewashing over you yeahand then coming out afterwards I thinkMark Healey definitely brought that inthat close out and said he had in thatlast Heat so adding to the excitementthat explosion disappearing actdisappearing actyeah it is uh you know surfing hasseveral types of magic tricks as wewatch okay Olivia mamala live actionnicely negotiated drop there it is alittle disappearing act right there sopipeline you got the disappearing act inthe barrel the reappearing kind ofAbracadabra style here at Waimea theWaimea magic trick is getting explodedat the bottom of the wave and then beingable to re-emerge and reappearand reallypull a big rabbit out of a big hatlooking out to the Horizon lookingpossiblywith more action headed our way here inHeat number three of round two 50-minuteHeats for these eight Surfers to catchup to four waves there\\'s a four wave Maxwhen you have eight Surfers in the waterbeing able toshare the lineup equally or as equallyas possibleand once you catch four waves in yourparticular Heatuh you are to move to the side or comein and or your you know your fifth waveand Beyond will not be scored obviouslybut that four wave Max implementedas we watch Kelly mamala one of his fourwavesthat\\'s that last one we just watchedthat section that movement blows rightover it disappear and comes right backout[Music]we\\'re gonna start you know getting intoour maneuver commentating when Kaylee isout there and uh raising a fist inVictory and appreciation kind of glidedover that section bottom turned andhopped and caught some air off thebottom to make it around that soincorporating a little bit of uhassistance from one of those chops atthe bottom going fins free for a secondand gaining speed in the processcool too about surface especially whenwe\\'re talking about Eddie Aikau forexample he was surfing became thevehicle for him to express his culturehe was a lot like his mom in the sensethat his mom they said was was not itwas very soft-spoken person and peoplewould know Eddie and even though there\\'sso muchattention on him in this event when hein his real life he didn\\'t want anyattention I was very humble guyvery good and uh said that he when hewould rescue or save somebody from thebeach you knowpeople would come up and want to thankhim and you knowbuy him something or you just give himthe simple Shaka man of few words andum so so but surfing was a vehicle forhim to express himself as a nativeHawaiian because surfing has its rootshere in Hawaii the tradition of what wecalland it\\'s pretty impressive to uh but inmany ways too I\\'d say some of the mostfamous Hawaiian people people likeducanumoku and Eddie I callwe\\'re surfers right and they were ableto establish and identify with theirculture through surfing during a timeperiod when a lot of Hawaiian culturalthings weren\\'t really celebrated and weespecially saw that in dukaku\\'s Era butwith with Eddie I call he represents histime period in 1960s and 1970sRebirth of identity and having pride inbeing Hawaiian because in Generationsprevious there wasn\\'t as much maybethere was a lot of you know frowning onHawaiian thingsbut it\\'s really cool that Eddie\\'s aproduct of that time period and becomesa great Ambassador for the culture ofSurfing and the culture of Hawaii we\\'regonna take a short break where Heatnumber three we\\'ll be right back after aword from our sponsors stay right herewe got more Eddie big wave Invitationalon

they\\'re close to eachother they are really close[Applause]yeah we got some real camaraderie hereyeahI think that\\'s Shane Dorianout in front and uh behind it might havebeen Peter Mel in the black looked likea darker colored Jersey we\\'ll get thatconfirmation though ID when we can butdefinitely look like shano was in thepurple coming towards us riding thatwave a little longer he was out in frontand uhpossibly Peter Mill in the black thedeeper Surfer kind of caught up to himand thenyou know those two guys they\\'ve been atthis for a while uh Peter probably alittle longer than Shane uh in the formof experience and and age level but uhthe uh appreciation and admiration equalamong both of those Surfers you knowSaint Doran has been an invitee to thiseventum since the early since the 90s so yeahhe\\'s been uh he\\'s a Mainstay in thesurfing world with big wave surfing yesone of those that pioneered you knowsurfing and Jaws on Maui and also helpwith the development of the safety vestthat they\\'re using yeah and you knowtalking earlier about the HawaiianRenaissance that Eddie was a part of andthat time frame of the 60s and 70s whenwe come to the early 2000s from the late90s to the early 2000s the attentionkind of shifted into the towing in bigwave Arena and the you know impressivethings you could do when you involve ajet ski and catching waves and theManeuvers because you didn\\'t have topaddle Shane Dorianwas part of that crewthe Renaissance crew if you will goingback to paddle in and the original formof wave catchingwow look how close they are to eachother that is Peter melon the blackhe isback in the blackcomesthe camaraderie therewow it\\'s like the Titanic yeahDon\\'t Let Gomight have been our first Embrace on awave during an Eddy I don\\'t know if thatwas like Hey call of my sorry brotherhey let\\'s do this together but we\\'re onit togetherGreat Waveso in that situation Peter Mill mightget the nod with a little bit higherscore being the deeper Surfer but onceagain no no penalty no interferenceand the non-priority situation just auhkind of gentleman gentlewoman\\'s prioritysituation out there who you know you cankind of see you know who\\'s in the betterspot and give way to those Surfers thatare in the spot and for yourself ifyou\\'re not you achieve to be in thatbetter spot on the next set so it\\'s areal[Music]camaraderie and not so much a hardcorecompetition even though 39 000 for thewinner excuse me ten thousand dollarsfor the winner does sound likea great payday and of course they\\'d loveto have each Surfer would have the loveto have their nameetched onto the Eddie Aikau big waveInvitational trophynow we\\'re seeing some more sets off thebackto the horizonwe\\'re talking about the Hawaiian waterPatrolis a lifeguard that tradition oflifeguarding and rescuing is has deeproots in Hawaii that goes even back totowas hired by the Red Cross to travelaround the United States and to teachpeople how to save people check out thiswave off the back a bomb oh my goodnessthere was some unfortunate soul on thatwave it was a colossal wall of waterUncle Clyde getting uh some work done onthe beach right there handling thedirecting you know part of it wants tobe out there but also there is uh youknow the responsibility of making sureeverything is going smoothly on thebeach and up in the scaffolding but wowa huge wave and a crazy Wipeout for oneof our Surfers looks like everybody\\'sokay but yeah I saw a small Speck and abig splash which isa pause you could see somebody catchingit and then there wasn\\'t anything andthen splashed right so that free fall uhlasted for a little while oh man remindsme a little bit of that we saw a ZekeLao earlierum and there was another server or SouthAfrican Surfer also had another one ofthose grand Twiggy Banker soman that definitely is dramatic we hopethat Surfer is okay and try and ID thatfor you in a moment you know most timesin the best case scenario of that badsituationyou are able to get some penetrationinto the wave and out the backas we see another ride here from one ofour goofy foot backside Surfers thatlooks to be orange Lucas[Music]who had an amazing ride earlier in thisheat now just adding some numbers to hisscore working that forward back andforthoh doing a turn oh wow carving it that\\'sa big board to be carving approachingthe inside shore break is he gonna makeit he\\'s gonna do it all over oh my goshand then just goes back on his heels butI think that might be the first time inEddie commentary we narrated Themaneuver floateron the shore going for it love this guysdefinitely got a lot of youthful energythat he brings to big wave surfing himand Kai Lenny have done amazing thingstogethersurfing there in Portugal with massivewaves and still you know do 360 errorson the kick outs and so I love the theenergy and the playfulness of it verymuch yeah he\\'s been at this big wavegame for a long time and worked reallyhard to be one of the you knowrecognizable names and always there uhwhether it was WaimeaNazareth Todo Santos all the big namebreaks Mavericks Lucas has been thereand he\\'s been there for a long time andhe\\'s still doing itplus these guys surfs really good onsmall waves too on shorter boards yeahit\\'s cool to seeum oh well hopefully he\\'s all right hereI see him getting some assistance up thebeach left the board forhis caddy to manage for him and justgetting onto The High Ground thecheckout possibly a knee injury possiblyan anklehe was hobbling up the beach you knowgetting some help hopping on that onefoothere is the Wipeout oh my gosh I thinkthat might have been chaolo Kennellyyeah in the blue just absolutely puttingit on the linehuge huge wave andthe amount of guts and commitment to beable to hurl yourself over a ledge likethat isalmost difficult to understand oh mygoodness she is so Fearless we\\'ve seenher in massive waves uh in Tahiti and inPipeline and now at Waimea just sendingit this was the last replay of Lucaschumble his leg seems okay at thatmomentI don\\'t know if it was uh we\\'ll we\\'lltry and see if it was the floater ormaybe when he was on the inside hisboard chopped him at the at the legs butwe\\'ll see what happens hereyeah he goes uphits the the whitewash right there andpossibly something underneath waterhappened right there he was rollingfairly close to his board andcould have uhhad contact with his board underwaterwhich you know another scary part ofSurfing waves like this is the equipmentthat you have to ride it\\'s not a little6-0 twig you know it is a huge heavy logwith a lot of sharp edgesand when you\\'re getting rolled in a bigwhite water like that the amount offorce that can be from your body andfrom your board can be very verydangerouswell good news is he\\'s he\\'s there andhe\\'s uh you know talking into the to oursafety crew andgetting the attention that he needshopefully it\\'s just something minora lot of folks stillchecking out the action live on thebeach right there a very unique view tobe basically ground level you knowGround Zero for seeing the mass heightof these waves and also feeling thatThunder of the crashing shore break andthe big waves on the outside and thenyou have kind of the second tierSpectators that are gathered along thecliffs and the Bluffsoh and some of the very lucky Spectatorsthat are in those houses that frontWaimea point right there there\\'s JustineDupont on that wave it looked like theuh have crossed with another competitoryeah Justine one of our two wahinecompetitors in this heat we saw kealaKennelly with the absolute charging thatlooked heavier than any white boat we\\'veseen today that chaos just sending itas the last one we are just in Dupontand another Rider there hopefully therewasn\\'tyou know interference on that one butthey got kind of close to each otheryeah that might have beenum it might have been keola joining herit was a goofy foot Surferand Lucas and keala are the only twogoofy foots in this heat so Lucas is onthe beach uh tending to uh possible leginjury or mishap there so we hope thebest for Lucas and I think that waskeala that was mixing it up and sharinga wave with Justinebig props to our female competitors allsix of them showing up strong all ofthem catching waves and Big Surf andcharging it and as I was saying earlieruh Rocky that it\\'sit\\'s it\\'s appropriate because inHawaiian culture in ancients Hawaiiantimes a lot of stories of Hawaiian womensurfing and most notably there\\'s onenamed keleaso kelea for short was from Maui and shewas one of the best Surfers of Hawaiiand so it\\'s hundreds of years ago in ouruh the annals of Hawaiian history andshe eventually moves over to Oahu whereshe becomes a a popular figure inWaikiki we\\'re pretty well known yeahyeah and where she ends up surfing anduh awesome waves here on Oahu but fromMaui powerful Chief and noted to beingyou know she marries a guy namedkalamuku who\\'s a chief in Waikiki andthe two of them become like the surfingpowered couple power couple yeah it\\'s agood good description they said when thewaves were huge she would go out to theouter breaks in Waikiki and ride thewaves all the way across the baysomething that Duke hanumoku was laternoted for doing on those rare occasionsto catch one from castles way all theway outside connects connecting it andso kelea was known as one of these greatwomen Surfers and so it\\'s so awesome tosee in this event uh it\\'s in this heatwe see Justine Dupont and Kayla Kennellycharging these massive waves here atWaimea Bay and uh so awesome awesome tobe revisiting history and and Legacy andand talking aboutEddie Aikau and the kind of Legacy hehad and admonition to all of us to tocarry on those kinds of values that werepassed on for Marco Puna like theseindividuals like Eddie I callwell we\\'ve gotHeat number threeactive right now some of heat numberfour might have made their way into thewater you see quite a few jerseys thatare in the lineup or around the lineuparea currently and that would be uh thatwould be the reason for that eightSurfers in each Heatin this second round we\\'re pushing thetime up to 50 minutes per heat as youlook up look at a great drone shot fromthe Waimea Point side looking Westtowardsthe Waianae mountain range in thebackground and the rest of the NorthShore that\\'s down towardsChantry flatio Kea all the way down toHaleiwa andshimmeringsunlight on the waterlooking quite tranquil right now onscreen but it is so crazy how it turnsto chaos and speaking of ControlledChaos our Spectators on the beach lookslike they\\'re all behaving themselvesenjoying yeah bro you are doing what youdo and uh great to see some Livelyenergy

off on waves like that what agreat performance what a inspiring asyou said earlier inspiring is uh youknowa light way to put it it\\'s beyondinspiration yeah well Billy Kemper beingan inspiring individual you can checkout the doc series Billy simply namedBilly from WSL films and it ChroniclesBilly\\'s injury near death injury inMorocco and his comeback afterabsolutely like I think breaking apelvisdestroying both of his knees having torelearn to walk again we getreconstructed coming all back throughall of that adversity and back in Actionfour-time Jaws champ Billy Kempercertainly one of the Premier Big WaveRiders in the world right now but yeahof all timeI do not disagree that wasvery well put and we\\'re in Heat numberfour right now so we\\'re watching oursecond to last Heat of the

suspense I know it\\'s killing youbecause it\\'s killing me but it\\'s gonnabe great we can look at some of ourstandout names so far so not necessarilythe winner but certainly the guys whoare on the top of that leaderboard neartop of the leaderboard Mark healy\\'s hada standout show so far Kai Lenny\\'s beena hero Ezekiel Lau Billy Kemper yepLandon McNamara John John Florence allof those Surfers have really put in anotable performance consistentperformance out here againfour waves in each heat allow top threewaves out of the two rounds go to yourscore and so how come why why attentionyeah maybe yeah seeking attention and uhgetting it for a momentum but oh that\\'s so much fun as we clearthe beach we\\'re gonna take a commercialbreak and uh we\\'ll be back with theconclusion of this heat for round numbertwo at the Eddie big wave Invitationalforeignthe absence of colorsomesee it as the sum of all colorsand out of the chaoscomes the spectrum of lifethe beauty of Hawaii is Florathe vast oceansthe peopleit\\'s culture[Music]hey you wanna order some taco boxforeign[Music][Music]what if an injured person or theirfamily doesn\\'t have money to pay alawyer after someone is seriouslyinjured they\\'re often worried aboutmedical bills rent just putting food onthe table the last thing that they canafford is to pay money to a lawyer andthat\\'s why at Levitt Yumani and soldnerwe never ask for money from injuredpeople everything is on a contingencyfee basis that means that it costsnothing to hire us and we only get paidif we recover for our clientback on the beach at Waimea Bay the siteof the Eddie big wave Invitational inmemory of ADI kaipo along with RockyCannon and pretty casual stroll down thebeach right now for Paige alms who\\'sgoing to be coming up in the last Heatof the day yeah heat five on the beachright there getting set tosurf their second round second heat ofthe day yep and I gotta imagine you knowit just takes so much out of youit\\'s only 45 minutes it\\'s only 50minutes but the adrenaline that\\'spumpingthe wipeouts you know the good ridesyou know even a good ride you have ahorrendous Wipeout at the end of so itis just taxing on the body I\\'m suregosh it\\'s surfing right so the paddle isa pull-up the pop-up to push-up yeah andyou got to hold your breath also yeahyou know and think about paddling forall your might is like sprinting Yesexcept you\\'re laying on your lungsinstead of upright yeah so gravity\\'s notin your favor gravity\\'s not in yourfavor and you know air is a commodity ohmy gosh and sometimes a luxury preciousyesyou\\'ll realize Rocky you know I mean usas Surfers but just to describe to theaudience how precious air is when it\\'staken away from youand you\\'re not in control of when you\\'regoing to have it again oh my gosh panicattackbut the Surfers are the most highlyconditioned athletes in my opinion byfar any other sport that you want tobring to the table uh and compareI would have to say the amount ofstrength and endurance the amount ofmental fear you have to overcome inthese kind of big wave situationsand holding your breath and being ableto swim I mean you know I love watchingother sports but you know sorry Mr NFLyou\\'re gonna die today if you go outtherehey LeBron yeah you stay up on the beachover here okay bro yeah that\\'s right andyou know surfing being more more thanjust a sport a celebration or cultureabsolutely and it\\'s a and it\\'s in somany ways so fulfilling and healing forpeople\\'s lives and so that\\'s why we\\'recelebrating surfing the sport of Surfingwe\\'re celebrating the active surfingwe\\'re celebrating the life times andLegacy of someone like Eddie Aikau whowas able to just contribute to helpingpeople saving livesa surfer a lifeguard a key part of thePolynesian voyaging Society whoselflessly was lost at sea afterpaddling away from the capsized Hokuleathe twin hold canoe you know it tryingto save his friends as they were in thatstormy dark scene in I think it was1978. and there has been uh an EddieAikau Foundation set up that we\\'d likeyou guys to visit when you have a timeyou can search the Eddie Aikaufoundation and you know doing exactly uhwhat Eddie would do which is give backto the community uhshare his love share the knowledge ofthe ocean and also literally put hisbody and his life on the line to helpothers return to the beach safely yeahand as Cole Christensen said you know asyou know Kohl\\'s in this heat he says thelegacy of Eddie that\\'s what we need toAspire to a higher standard of humanconnection and we get to do

break this yearyou talked about the sand Rocky theBruce irons here you know 2000 uh 2004when Bruce pulled in on the show rightthere was a different sand situation itseemed like in the short break where theshore break was much hollower yeah rightnow the waves seem like they\\'re rollingthrough yeah and it\\'s kind of you knowChanges Day by Day obviously uh with thethe positioning of the sand so muchwater moving but it seems like for thisparticular day it\\'s not forming upthat\\'s with that same you knowferociousness and veracity as it wasduring that Bruce irons uh Victoryalthough we could see the sand movearound a little bit we haven\\'t seen ashore break Connection in a couple ofHeats now but the ones we did see therewere a lot of double ups and triple upsand not really the gaping barrel uh thatwe sometimes mostly see at Waimea shorebreak but there\\'s a nice big long dropfor our Surfer in red that was JamieMitchell nicely negotiated there and onthe outside Billy Kemperfree falls into one thatgets quite foamy and as you said kaipothat soupy sectionyou know almost looks like Mom\\'s cornchowder right there with a couplepotatoes did pop over and uhnibletsright inside but

injured Billy Kemper right John JohnFlorence has been sneaky quiet making itlook easy but it has been Gathering bigscores and he\\'s our defending champ canJohn John do it again we\\'re going tofind out after this final heat of theday and let\\'s uh talk about this heatright now first we got some sets comingin before we can do a heat introductionso we\\'ll see if anyone catches a waveand we\\'ll then we\\'ll get to uh theSurfers eight Surfers out in the waterand these are walls mountains of waterright now likely we\\'re gonna have atakereveryone looking at that one and thatone just sucks off of The Reef youmentioned the wind earlier and how it\\'sgetting a little stronger and we noticethe ehukai the Ocean Spray off the topof the wave reaching a little higher andmore pronounced than early this morningso providing yet another obstacle if youwill for dropping in on these huge wavesuh besides the fact that they\\'re about50 feet tall wave and current coming upthat face makes it extra tricky anddifficult yeah here we go look at thiswe\\'ll see againif we have any takers there\\'s the packout there eight Surfers out in the waterwho wants this oneand again just trying to defy gravitybut just the physics of paddling intothat wave look too difficult yeah noteven Albert Einstein could complete thatone and he\\'s like what I don\\'t care whatthe heck is going on here this is notright the math just doesn\\'t add upinertia volume speed pause it all add upso that I can paddle into this MovingWall of ocean and not just because tocatch a wave you have to first of all wetalk about physics you have to match thespeed of the wave in the first place tocatch the wave and bigger waves thebigger the wave is faster right correctso the the faster you have to paddle tocatch a bigger wave yeah and thenthere\\'s an inertia that you have tocarry to get down the face of the waveI got my chalkboard right here we\\'refiguring out all kinds of algebra yeahalgorithmsalgebraithms for sure getting busted outright everybody through connect that\\'srighthere we go here\\'s a replay this happenedduring the break oh my goodness just uhcrazy late drop that was super well donethat

don\\'t wantto get anybody\\'s hopes up but it is justan amazing drop right there for blackTyler Laurent wowsecond generation Big Wave Rider fromMaui and uhliking the feeling there he was claimingitcelebration time for Tyler Laurent thatwas a healthyhugevertical drop that he just negotiatedfrom here looked quite easy but folksthat wasa lot of technical skill to get downthat wave and a lot of bravado to evenpaddle yourself into that way yeah TylerRon 27 years old from Maui uh firstEddie that he\\'s experiencing right nowwhoa and another drop thereRoss Clark Jonesstill doing it Ross Park Jones our 2001Eddie champ and he\\'s still at it goshwhat a relic and a legend living legendjust incredible to see him still outhere and he\\'s out there with Michael hoand when you start to uh you know thinkof the amount of years of experience thecombination of those two Surfers inparticular it is uh over a century yeahI mean it\\'s Ross Clark\\'s eighth Eddiethat he\\'s surfing in you know he tookthat win but he also placed thirdyou know uh and in uh in the Eddie inthe past he\\'s got hit fifth place he\\'sbeen consistent in his finishes here butof course the big win was in 2001 forrcj yeahand it looks like possibly a loose boardnow it might beI was gonna say had the old school jbgairbrush that board of the unmistakableMcCool rock man so we\\'ll see uh seewhere he is more importantly than theboard we see the board making it all theway to Shore and uh hopefully Hawaiianwater Patrol is uhin the company of makua Rothman outthere so broken leash it appears formakua Rothmanand wow the board did not stopthat whole wave completed ride for theboard here we go out the back in BlackTyler Laurent that is uhmassive Eddy type wave that Tyler justnegotiated very nicely and the watershot looking in and you see the wavejust grow and it was actually Hollow fora moment I thought he might try to sneakin there but wisely just stays out infront of it as we watch yellow

pipeline he\\'ll be in the booth withme talking about surfing but right nowhe\\'s doing the surfing mccookai Rothmanlook at that unrated wave and thatBarrel just open up at Waimea and thenshut so abruptlyall right time check we\\'re at 36-35loving the Eva birdangles that we\\'re getting here from theDrone just sweeping over the lineupgiving us an idea of the positioning ofthe Surfers you can see that boil rightthere yepthat notorious boil Infamous and Michaelho right there yeah he\\'s right on theboil that\\'s the veteran right there 65years young oh here\\'s our award and withthat iconic shot of ADI cow yep thatveryinternationally known famous red boardhe wascaptured writing for so many years outhere at Waimea we saw a rider rightthere was Ramon novaro in the red jerseyor Chilean chargeryeah Ramon Navarro I think you rememberI think in 20um2000 2009 Ramon rode that crazy wave andnearly closed out the bay here\\'s thereplay of Navarroyeah and at one point in time you knowhewould have been possibly our first goofyChampion he was right there kind ofscratching at the tips of theleaderboard clawing his way to the thetopportion of yeahthat year and uh just couldn\\'t quitepull it off yeah 2009 he got fifth but Imean he was right there he was at thetop of the leaderboard at one pointmakukai Rothman and Hawaiian waterPatrol battling their way back out intothe lineup how hard is that yeah that isjust a tough sledding like we saidearlier andtrying to read the ocean that is got somany differentchops and waves and you knowsidewash backwash huge white wash so alot of different angles and a lot ofdifferent looks that you have to beaware of when you\\'re on board that jetski because that\\'s a lot of washing butit\\'s not clean inside there oh you knowit\\'s not clean yeah maybe the dirtiestwash you\\'ll ever get but you know andthen you factor in the you know thespectatorinfluence and awareness that you havethat you\\'re on stage right basicallythere\\'s nowhere to hide and you\\'re nothiding especially if you fall off theski and you\\'re underwater you\\'re stillnot hiding everybody knows what happenedandto try to operate safely to prevent thatfor one it\\'s you know uha loose jet ski a lot of times is is ahazard in itself so just staying onboard is very difficult staying on boardif I would drop like that also verydifficult I believe that was Ramon onceagain in the red yeah the goofy foot andthen out in front was uhpossibly page alms yeah so page arms onthe shoulder there and Ramon Navarrotaking a straightcrazy drop on the back end but againgetting engulfed by the White Water herein the final heat of the day this is thefinal Heatof round number two replay here yeahRamon just in that super deep positionyou see all the water kind of coming upthe side of his rail indicating howsteep that drop was and how close he wasto not making the drop and then once hegot to the bottom there was nowhere torun that wave was right on top of themmore lines here Rocky formulating sonthe hit reef atWaimea Anticipation by our competitorsand positioning you can see on theinside there and the yellow Jersey RossClark Jones the deepest Michael ho inthe orange Jersey right on the boilgetting ready to gofirst wave of the set looks like a steepit looks like a bigger second wave yeahyou know these first waves they\\'reeither the forerunners or they\\'re theones with that really gnarly hairy dropthat we\\'ve been seeing andlooks like we\\'ve got Michael Hallpaddling for this one he\\'s up and ridingthrough the mist and the fog he holds onit was yellow out in front looked likeRoss Clark Jones possiblyoh but might have been down oh 65 yearsyoung oh look at this setwow that\\'s whiteLuke shepherdson again scoring so wemight see Luke\\'s name sliding up thatleaderboard as he has turned in a coupleof good rides in this last Heatpretty incredible surfing holy moly talkabout hurting a flock of sheep ashepherd\\'s in ah fish phenomenon is realoh man that\\'s right Luke shepherdson theNorth Shore Surfer spent years here justdoing it for the love 27 years old in2015 Luke shepardson got one of thebiggest wavesum of the year of maybe of all time hereat Waimea so he\\'s the quiet stories thatwe get to learn about here at the Eddieyeah you might not have uh heard toomuch about him in other surf eventsalthough he has done well in Adventureon the North Shore but Luke putting hisname on the map now and uh Michael ho inthe back right there once again anotherSuper steep drop and then it\\'s like onceyou get to the bottom you\\'re just aSitting Duck basically of like okay nowwhat do I do and uh basic grit and beartry to hold on Shepard sand from thisangle shows the true size of his waveand then that High Line to complete it Ithought he was gonna like you know tryto re-entry or something it\\'s crazy likethat but I think he was you knowwanting to get back out to have time forone more but he\\'s the kind of guy thatwe could see on his last ride you knowtry to go for that epic Shore BreakGrand Finale yeah as we see our waterpatrols zooming through the water againthe format we had 45 minute Heats eightSurfers in each

afternoonsunlight a bit silhouetted now we switchangles and able to see his very brightred jersey the goofy foot stanceunmistakably Ramon Navarro and trying towork his way to the shore break we\\'llsee if it happens he\\'s got theconnection andlike we\\'ve talked about earlier theshore break notbut just as entertaining yeahyou slide band and you slide your finson the sand to finish pretty well donegood feeling right there look at Ramonyeahand he\\'s energized he wants to run backup into the corner but paddle back outagainalso opting for the four fin setup isRamon Navarrothat\\'s not enough time try surf some ofthe beach crowd and Hawaiian waterPatrol yeah there\\'s Ramones there\\'salcohol UncleMelvin\\'s right there hammer time soRamon look he\\'s in good shape 43 yearsyoung and still enjoying it oh yeahwith her phone down there you betterlook up girlrunning way beyond the yellow team staybehind the Yellow Tape how many timesyou got to tell you guys don\\'t don\\'ttext and watch the Eddie standing by theshoreline hey man don\\'t eat anotherperson not even texted across the roadyou guys what are you doing here we goRamon teetering and making it up throughthe drop Rocky yeah I like uh hisnegotiation right there taking itstraight down to increase the thedramatic effect of being engulfed inthat white water not taking the easyroad to the right side but goingstraight downsurviving the hammer surviving the chopandre-emergingriding all the way throughthe bumpy soup right here anda couple of chops could have taken himdown but he\\'s got a solid stance littlecarve to the the backhand right thereand then switches Direction back to theleft looking for the barrel but insteadit likes to ride straight out and evensurvive that second explosion like rightthere that was impressive that was solidso are the solid lines coming throughhere time for it everyone to scratch itto position spins around there yellowgoes for him it has to spin around thatwas Ross Clark Jones put himself in adeep position right now we\\'ll see whathappens to Ross Clark yeah the next waveeven biggerrcj the deepest the furthest in thiswave is Feathering Rocky it is huge Rossis not going to make this one no I don\\'tthink sooh oh that\\'s the worstoh oh that\\'s breaking really far out andRoss is rightaway nowhere to be seenhe\\'s somewhere in that area in thatwhitewash that you couldn\\'t see him withthe wave in the foreground but where hewas paddlingI don\\'t think he was gonna make it overchose to pound for the first wave ofthat set couldn\\'t get into it then everysurfer\\'s nightmare yeah spin around andand you know what though every singer\\'snightmare scaled up yeah quite a fewnotches yeah but he\\'s back on his boardalready Rocky I just saw himthat\\'s what Champs are made out ofalready back on his board paddling backout Ross Clark Jones or 2001 Eddie champout therewhat a heroflying by you can see the boils in thelineup and the positioning of ourcompetitors outside of those boils rightnow Rocky yeah there\\'s that one reallypronounced boil you can see going up alot of the big waves and that\\'ssometimes the you know the the indicatorpositioning point that the Surfers arestriving to be behind the boil look atthe animal Ross Clark Jones where he\\'ssitting so far inside now you know andhe just he\\'s almost humbled daring whiteman as well he\\'s like I\\'m still gonnasit here I\\'m still gonna do itRamon Navarro asking about time how muchmore time left in this heat the finalheat of the day sets again looming onthe horizonand emptying on to the Deep Reef here atWaimeayeah such a crazy pronounced shelf wherethe waves break and they have to comefrom water that\\'s so deep and that\\'s whythe wave just jacks up and gets so steepI mean itit does something that I think is youknow very unique especially along waveshere on the North Shore to where it\\'sjust so much water and hits that Reef sobut it\\'s still a pretty deep wave rightso Rocky like what\\'s it what\\'s it feelwhat\\'s it how deep is it like if you hitthe bottom at Waimea how deep on thewater are you I mean you\\'re going atleast15 to 20 feet down and that\\'s that\\'svery deep I mean you start to feel thepressure in your ears when you\\'re thatfar down and I\\'ve never hit the reefhere at Waimea but I know Surfers whohave yeah and uh it\\'s it\\'s always like acome again you know did you say you justhit the reef oh my gosh but if you didhit the reef you also know it\\'s a longway up to find the surface and air againif you feel like you\\'re bouncing on thebottom at Waimea or touch the bottomyeahyou know you\\'re in trouble uh veryvery scary position to be in and umsome more waves approaching it\\'sdefinitely not slowing down as we hitthis afternoon uh type of day uh time ofday and lots more surfingheading our way and we could see someonefrom this heatjump up to the top sure on theleaderboard and take the title of Eddiechampionyou know normally this time of day wecall it Paul Hana where you\\'re done withwork but today it\\'s not Paul Hanabecause I don\\'t think anybody went towork other than our

thisuh you can see this drone shot flyingover the competitors and we talk aboutthe depth here at the reef at Waimea Baybut these waves are so powerful you cansee the sand that\\'s caught in betweenthe coral getting spit up in plumesbecause of how much water\\'s moving andsweeping through the bay and like wesaid it\\'s deep water so the energy ofthese waves actually reaching the bottomyeah shows you just the broad span ofenergy that has uh you know been able toaffect the bottom of the ocean and bringup those sand plants now you got likehey like octopus and lobsters just likesqueezing yeah they\\'re just hanging onthrough the walls trying to hang inthere on the right knuckling what\\'shappening today what\\'s happening todayis the Eddie uh I think we\\'re gonna goto a commercial to

Waimea surfing oh my gosh gettingblown out the backI\\'m not look maybe like it was whiteLuke Shepherds and he\\'s been the guy inthe spot in this last Heat getting acouple nice rides he had a few fromearlier as well in his round one Heatso he\\'s beenkind of dialing himself in to the themost gnarly positions and you know had afew where he had to kind of bail out thetop like that but just being in the spotwas uh part of the battle for we weretalking earlier about Paul Hana timewhich is after work time which we are inbut we were working Luke shepherdson isworking today as well he\\'s a city andcounty lifeguard wow he went to hiscaptain today his captain allowed him totake a couple of one-hour breaks so hecould surf his Heattalk about an inspirational story notime off for Luke shepherdson it\\'seither you\\'re saving people or you\\'recharging Waimea yeah andyou knowso much Mahalo to Luke and the job hedoes daily as the city and countylifeguard something you can be sospecial for him to be able to have acouple hours of break time and you knowby the way there\\'s nothing elsehappening on the North Shore uh ifyou\\'re swimming at pipeline I you know Imean that\\'s the best of luck to you butit\\'s all here it\\'s happening here butthis is true our student comedylifeguards however are busy today asthey are and every time we got Big Surfover here they\\'re the heroes on theshoreline Luke shepardson\\'s beenone of the most impressive Surfers atthis Eddie in my book Rocky I mean he\\'sjust the waves the lines the commitmentright off the charts yeah hispositioning he\\'s got it dialed in heseems prettypretty one with the ocean uh but youcan\\'t count out guys like Z Cloud JohnJohn was on the leaderboard there at thetop uh after a couple of waves but rightnow we\\'re gonna keep the suspense butwe\\'re just kind of highlighting some ofour highlights crazy waves that we\\'veseen uh Mark Healey put down a couplehuge big rides landed McNamara was upthere too so it is going to be uh uhcoming down to the wire as we saw a rideduring our commercial break from ourSurfer in yellow and Ross Clark Jonesthe 2001 Eddie champ getting a anotherride under his belt his uh seventh Eddieyeah sorry eighth eighth Eddie YeahEddie so he\\'s clocked in some seriousEddy heat time right behind him oh thedrop and the spill thereStyleyou know very amazing human being sothat\\'s why all these milesa little bit of a breathing room likeyou said earlier a little Tranquilityout there a little piece and calm beforethe storm of these walls and mountainsof water that are still hammering thebay and you\\'ve got to think a lot of theSurfersthat like to charge Waimea that aren\\'tin the events which there are a lot itis only a select chosen 40 that cancompete in this one day event but yougot to think there\\'s going to be a lotof chargers out there even after theevent oh yeah that\\'s uh anytime it\\'sbreaking it\\'s uh it\\'s something that youknow a lot of surfers want to check offyour list but you know to reality in ourwe have we do have a new surfing crowdand a lot of people are coming intosurfing and they\\'re very athletic peopleright and they\\'re capable of paddlingright and swimming and holding theirbreath but remember you know in surfingwe still haveunspoken kind of rules that keep thingsin we have a hierarchy still you knowabsolutely as we watch I think that\\'smakura back out there after breaking aleash having to come all the way toshoreand uh re-gathering himself again he\\'ssurfing with it with a big knee injuryhe\\'s sustained has a a knee brace onright now and is playing through thepain yeah the true warrior mccookaiRothman yeah injured himself at pipelineduring the back door shootoutdid a pretty good Twist on his ACL andhoping for a

enables you to move onmove forward in your life with someconsideration of other people and justin moments where there is good to bedone as the Eddie akau Foundation saysthat you\\'ll be more prone and apt tomake sure you\\'re part of that slogan aswell yeah I like itEddie Aikau umsaved so many lives it was such a greatexample for actually for young Hawaiiansas well as well asfor ocean goes everywhere Surferseverywhere and voyagers with the workthat he did with the hokule yes and thePolynesian voyaging Societyand really one of the instruments of theHawaiian Renaissance in the late 70sthat made native Hawaiians start to feelproud of their culture proud of theirlanguage proud of their practices andwhat the practices issurfing yepand then you know just the oceanknowledge you know how to how to conductyourself in and around the ocean in andaround your your fellow peers that arealso enjoying the oceanum and there\\'s something to be said alsoof someone like Eddie who just you knowknows what current to use to paddle backout you know little things like that goa long way in the way you conductyourself in your particular lineup andnot only being one of the ocean but alsolike we\\'ve been talking about yourfellow Surfers and the etiquette and therest that goes with being and carryingthe responsibility as a surfer Yeah inour community right in the and theHawaiian kind of concept of ofhumbleness in that the ocean will humbleyou and for sure approaching the oceanand these guys right now every singleone of these Surfers men and womenthey\\'re humble individuals but at thesame timespecial you know exceptional humanbeings to be able to to do what they doand ride these waves but at the sametime you talk to any of these big WaveRiders you\\'ll find some of the mosthumble down-to-earth people becausethey\\'ve learned the lesson that yeah theocean is bigger than all of us right youknow and it\\'s something to be respectedand celebrated and and to take care ofit yeah and you mentioned you know thethe guts and the and the commitment toride these waves but I think you knoweven more is like the guts andcommitment to come back from these crazywipeouts and survive the wipeouts whereyou know the the normal human being isnot peddling out there and then maybe alittle ex exceptional they would go outthere but then get drilled and be rightback on the beach going I want no moreof that yeah these guys and girls thesewomen and men competitorsjust keep going back out for more andthat\\'s what\\'s the exceptional thingabout them and to come back frominjuries

two words that mean somuch a symbol of some of the best ofHawaiian culture a steward thatprotected all life and respected natureany I count Hawaiian hero and Pioneer ofbig wave surfingEdward Ryan makua hanai ikau was born onMaui and according to family lore begansurfing at the age of 11. the AikauOhana soon moved to Honolulu where Eddiegrew up to become not only the firstlifeguard at Waimea Bay but the firstCity and County of Honolulu lifeguardfor the entire North Shore of Oahu as alifeguard Eddie would charge out intowaves of 30 feet or more when no oneelse would go out Eddie would gothank youand along the way Eddie would become aworld-class athlete Surfer Watermanwinning the premier world surfingcontest of the day the 1977 DukeKahanamoku Invitational surfingchampionship and at the time as only thesecond native Hawaiian to win thesurfing Championship along with hisbrother Clyde Eddie became a symbol ofThe Rebirth of Hawaiian culturalDiscovery in the ocean and in 1978 hebecame a part of another symbol ofHawaiian pride and culture and he joinedthe Polynesian voyaging society as acrew member of the okaywhen we stop and think about Eddie\\'sfinal Journey his quest to save his crewhis Ohana as he was paddling out into araging ocean looking for help for hisfellow Hokulea crew members you have toask yourself could you go[Music]this is why we are so proud to celebratethe life and never-ending Legacy ofEddie Aikau as one of the most iconicHawaiians ever to live with the annualEddie iCal big wave invitation[Music]foreign[Music]conception in 1984 it\\'s only been heldnine times with Waimea Bay providing thebackdrop to the world\\'s Premier big wavesurfing event an invitation only eventwith the world\\'s best servers where theLegacy and Aloha of Eddie Aikau lives on[Music]founded in 1776 just 5 days before theDeclaration of Independence was signedSan Francisco has always been a citymore than comfortable with radicalchange whether we\\'re talking about thegold rush or World Wars the beatnickshanging in the marina in the \\' 50s thehippies flocking to the hate in the 60sor Gay Liberation rising out of theCastro in the 7s the Techno utopianhackers of the\\'80s building the networksthat would become the foundation of our21st century internetage raw rugged fickle frustrating when Imoved to San Francisco more than 10years ago these were the adjectives thatI heard thrown around trying to captureand describe the San Francisco surfingexperience and all of them areabsolutely true but that doesn\\'tdescribe the surf culture in communityhere which since the 1960s has been oneof the most tight-knit and under theradar surf scenes in America and much ofthat started right here and FortPoint on the Southern Bank of the milewide Golden Gate straight tucked on theEastern side of the internationallyrecognizable suspension bridge of thesame name is one of surfing\\'s mosticonic lineups I think this is thebiggest novelty wave in the world it\\'soffshore it\\'s clean there few wavesdespite having one of the most instantlyrecognizable backdrops of any wave inthe world the scene at Fort is asunderground as they come Dean Jamie andI started our SF Mission a few of thecrew that have held fort down fordecades when we first surfed here toowas still illegal MPS it was militarybase for some reason they didn\\'t thinkyou should surf here and they put on alltheir sirens and call you out of thewater you throw the ticket away and whenthe Park Service took over they justsaid have at it you know this is greatgo[Music]surfing[Music]I served here way less when I was ateenager because it was pretty heavyVibes and then when people in the lineupare like anyone could surf here it\\'slike you\\'ve been here for 5 minuteswaiting for a wave they\\'ve been waitingfor like 50 years through no wet suitsMPS just a totally differentexperience[Music]so much energy moving around out therewild L Samuels might have got the dubsaw him get a couple little corners onthe inside it gets better it\\'s oftenworse we surf a lot worse they call itthe office it\\'s just like going to workout there stayingwet over the last two decades theinternet has ushered in theunprecedented Bay Area Tech Boom theimpact of Silicon Valley money thecity\\'s skyrocketing cost of living thedisplacement of the working class ithasn\\'t been easy to witness for localslike third generation San FranciscanMattieLopez there\\'s this thing where like nowthe people that moved to San Franciscorank themselves based on how longthey\\'ve been here I judge them based onlike are you going to be here are yougoing to stay are you going to have yourkids here are your kids going to be herebecause this neighborhood there\\'s peoplethat have lived here for Generationsthat made the community here that youlike that you moved into do you want topreserve that or you trying to changethat Mattie owns and operates two of thesunset\\'s favorite at watering holesWhite Cap and pits post surf Staples fora cold beer or craft cocktail the surfculture in San Francisco wasn\\'t basedaround like the surf industry orcontests they were working class theywere working class they weren\\'t gettingpaid they weren\\'t sponsored that\\'s thehuge difference between San Franciscoand these bigger beach towns it\\'s likethe the surf DNA is totally differentthe surf industry and competitivesurfing and sponsors are totallyimmersed in Southern California andSanta Cruz and that\\'s not even a part ofthis you know it\\'s like not the[Music]deal my dad is a native San Franciscanthat started surfing here in the 70swhen he was 15 he went into wise to buya board and a wet suit he\\'s like I wantto be a surfer and Bob tried to talk himout of it Bob was like you don\\'t want tobe are you sure you want to be a surferand like Bob had like just opened hisbusiness you know was probably like notmaking a lot of money and Bob\\'s sittingthere trying to talk him out of becominga surfer they were old and they werebitter and you know all that good [ __ ]but that\\'s our culture you know it\\'sfoggy it\\'s cold yeah it\\'s not invitingno but it\\'s just kind of like SanFrancisco in general you know it\\'s notfor the faint of heart that\\'s why mostpeople do their 5 to 10 years and theythey[Music]bounce and then walk us through some ofthese photos this is Kelly\\'s this isKelly\\'s Cove right hereKelly\\'s is just like the easiest accessit\\'ssemi-protected so that became the spotyou know but this is how they used to doit back in the day everyone hung out onthe wall what a sick scene though justlike everyone kicking it yeah like lookthere\\'s tons of surfers at Kelly\\'s Imean you see all these boards that\\'s theepicenter of San Francisco surfculture most days locals like Maddiespend a lot of time driving the 3 and1/2 miles of up and down the legendaryGreat Highway looking for just the rightSandbar starting at the North End of thebeach at Kelly\\'s you check Balboa vfw\\'sthen behind a few hundred yards of sanddunes past pillbox Lincoln Judah all theway to noraga Street which Begins theso-called middle of the beach andstretches all the way to SLO Boulevardand the end of ocean beach at FortFunston scoring perfect Ocean Beachain\\'t easy but with stiff easterly windsand a healthy pulse of long period NorthPacific ground swell a few days a yearOcean Beach is the best beach break inNorth[Music][Music]America[Music]nthis is like a combination of a big waveand a class 5 River because you\\'ve gotthe entire Bay which is 400 square milesmoving in and out every time the tidechanges so even if it\\'s small it feelsbig Bianca is a radical change agent andring leader of the outer bar babes afierce crew of women of all ages pushingthemselves and bigger and bigger surfdemanding as it is Ocean Beach is aperfect big wave training ground andafter reloc ating from SouthernCalifornia a decade ago Bianca hasdeveloped a reputation as one of thebest female big wave Surfers of all timethis spee I think has number one deathsthroughout all of California yeah andbecause of the current and the rips thisbeach is no joke 1998 we had sevendrownings at this beach that was 10% ofall ocean drownings this was the mostdangerous beach in the nation in thatyear 1998 it\\'s three in one day but thewave itself it\\'s not a super supercritical Wave It\\'s not like surfingsuper tubos or something really reallytechnical it\\'s just navigating thisocean that is so technical there\\'s notlike defin channels and you\\'ll bepaddling for a half hour the mostfrustrated you\\'ve ever been you knowit\\'s kind of like surfing Ocean Beach ona bigger day yeah it\\'s a pain in the assit\\'s a nice pain in theass and then the community the reasonwhy I love living here is for thecommunity you got to be pretty hardcoreyou got to be a glutton for punishmentto Surf this beach and so I find thatpeople who like that have a lot ofcharacter and can also take that skilland surf anywhere in the world so I feelreally really lucky to be part of thiscommunity and so inspired by all thepeople who come through the new peoplewho show up it\\'s just like awesomepeople here people with thick skin butthey\\'ve all got really big hearts and alot of passion thick skin and big heartsyeah thick skin big hearts once it\\'s sobig that it\\'s hard to make it back outthat\\'s usually when we\\'re going to surfMavericks a short drive 20 M south fromOcean Beach is Half Moon Bay the LittleHarbor Village of Pillar Point and rightout front the most famous big wave inCalifornia and one of the heaviest wavesin the world Mavericks when we weregrowing up like I always thought you hadto serve Mavericks it wasn\\'t like a ohit\\'s a choice I just thought that waslike what you do every session out thereis so unique and different and scaryit\\'s all the[Music]things one of the Mount Everest ofSurfing like it\\'s just that Pinnaclewave one of the big three when I grew upit\\'s like WEA Mavericks Jaws theatmosphere is is just seems a lotheavier than Hawaii it\\'s sunny it\\'s warmand then here it\\'s like great whitesharks kelp freezing water like gnarlylocals not warm I think Bianca just hasit you know she likes it and she\\'sathletic she has a lot of experience Ithink she\\'s probably the best girl atMavericks in the world it\\'s superinspiring she\\'s just such a great rolemodel and such a good person and to seenow like how she\\'s kind of taking Zoeunder her Wing now that I\\'m kind of likeflying the cpop a little bit now for methe most fun part is getting to MentorZoe being a surfer from Half Moon Bayyou\\'re kind of like destined toeventually surf Mavericks so shedefinitely will be so gnarly in bigwaves and to see like the nextgeneration of women\\'s big wave surfingis reallycool Biancacongratulations for Surfers like MarkValenta a writer and creative directorat Adobe Studios San Francisco is a cityof endless professional opportunity forartists writers designers and anyoneworking in Creative Fields today mostmajor tech companies operating out ofSan Francisco have a healthy populationof surfer labor I think surfingincreases productivity because whenyou\\'re like trying to crack some problemthinking about something you\\'re workingon sometimes it doesn\\'t come to you atyour desk right just go out into thewater and it\\'s like a bolt of lightningand you\\'re like boom there it is it isthis really big contrast between likemodern tech with like old San FranciscoCisco you know Blue Collar hoodiecollar up on Market you\\'ve got Twitterright here you\\'ve got you know Zingawhich I guess is still separate or is itowned by meta I don\\'t even know I can\\'tkeep up with it it\\'s hard to overstatethe sheer cultural political andeconomic effect that Bay Area Tech hashad on the world over the last threedecades things that we take for grantedtoday smartphones and personal computersdigital design tools and POV digitalcameras every variety of social mediaand app-based service like Uber orAirbnb they were all dreamed up within afew miles of SanFrancisco no Surfer has harnessed modernTech\\'s creative tools disruptive powerand Democratic Spirit more than JamieO\\'Brien j o used social media platformslike YouTube to redefine andrevolutionize what it means to be aprofessional Surfer I think the Jamiethat the public seen now was completelyswitched on already pre YouTube pre-social media pre- email he\\'s alreadylike grinding out with his own filmerand self-producing his own movies he wasdoing that way before that even had achance to live on the internet when thatwas going on to DVD he\\'s creating hisown projects and creating his own valueto his sponsors outside of just doingevents I went to Rip Curl and I was likeI want to make a Jamie O\\'Brien movieright and they\\'re like we\\'re not readyfor a Jamie O\\'Brien movie yeah we\\'reready or not we\\'re going to make one Ihad control of my own surfing career andI was like boom put out the movieeveryone loved it it was a huge successthe surf photographer the surf filmmakerthe magazine editor all these otherpeople were these layers betweenwhatever it is you wanted to release tothe world yeah andyou I think another thing Jam\\'s beenable to do is connect with a lot ofdifferent Surfers I\\'m a huge fan dudeI\\'ve been watching who was J OB since2.0 dude oh you\\'re Legend I appreciateit [ __ ] yeah that\\'s sick to meet youthat\\'s so sick is he has an approachablepersonality outside of the water thatmakes like somebody that will never comeclose to being able to ride a wave likethat at pipeline be able to have aconversation with him it\\'s like adifferent level of connection I didn\\'trealize how famous he actually is within5 minutes there\\'s like 30 people comingup to him a fire truck stops in themiddle of the road and the guy is likeyelling out the window like jo he genuinely gives everybody the timeof day and is so nice and he loves thefact that like he can just Stoke peopleout if it\\'s your job to create contentit has to be something people want towatch no one would have in the absenceof an Internet signed you up for thecareer path that was soft top pipelinejackass Specialists right like thatwasn\\'t a career path no we um kind ofmade it happenI think that my whole goal is like tryand make relatable content and being apositive role model for the NextGeneration you know like no swearing andno alcohol in our show just a clean cutfun but our Antics kind of speak foritself I feel like it\\'s like the theperfect platform so you guys are doingthat [ __ ] soberyeah I just want to let you know there\\'sno way that this water\\'s57°freezing Surfers might disagree on a lotbut it\\'s an almost universallyacknowledged truth that onetechnological advancement has completelychanged the everyday Surfers reality thebiggest thing for me personally is thesurf forecasting probably number oneimpact of the internet on surfing hasbeen cameras and that has totallychanged people\\'s relationship withsurfing surf line the cameras theforecast the utility of it has changedlike everything in surfing surf lineallowed you to kind of have the life youwanted to to have and still be able togo surfing the ability to just be ableto track swells all over the planet atany time of the year and then if youhave the time and the means to just dropeverything and get there you might getthe day of days prior to Surf line Ithink if you really wanted to be a coreSurfer you were limited geographicallyand like financially like you\\'d neverget a good job but um with surf lineyeah you could live anywhere theinternet has also helped to attract andcatalyze creative communities Johnmccambridge opened Mullis in 2007 andused their blog to broadcast all theradical things that were happeninginside their Cosmic little Sunsetcompound with a focus on their roster ofworld-renowned Heritage and AV on guardShapers and Craftsmen and established aswell as emerging painters musiciansfilmmakers and artists so part of thereason I opened up the shop is becauseyou couldn\\'t get these sorts of boardsanywhere in San Francisco or anywhere inNorthern California really so I was likeI want to ride these boards I my friendswant to ride these boards there shouldbe a place that sells these boards widepoint forward Wide Point back any sortof fish you want any sort of egg youwant I just love design we also had thegallery aspect too so we had like sortof like more the Arts[Music][Applause]thing[Music][Applause][Music][Applause]this was almost like a forgottenneighborhood we used to go out in thecity and we would tell people that welive in the sunset and they wouldn\\'tknow what it was and that\\'s why thesunset was cool the sunset was cool forbeing not cool you know I grew up insalana beach in San Diego and I in NorthCounty and I

REN-ə-sahnss) is a period in history and a cultural movement marking the transition from the Middle Ages to modernity, covering the 15th and 16th centuries and characterized by an effort to revive and surpass the ideas and achievements of classical antiquity; it occurred after the crisis of the Late Middle Ages and was associated with great social change in most fields and disciplines, including art, architecture, politics, literature, exploration and science. In addition to the standard periodization, proponents of a \"long Renaissance\" may put its beginning in the 14th century and its end in the 17th century.The traditional view focuses more on the Renaissance\\'s early modern aspects and argues that it was a break from the past, but many historians today focus more on its medieval aspects and argue that it was an extension of the Middle Ages. The beginnings of the period—the early Renaissance of the 15th century and the Italian Proto-Renaissance from around 1250 or 1300—overlap considerably with the Late Middle Ages, conventionally dated to c.\\u20091350–1500, and the Middle Ages themselves were a long period filled with gradual changes, like the modern age; as a transitional period between both, the Renaissance has close similarities to both, especially the late and early sub-periods of either.\\nThe Renaissance\\'s intellectual basis was its version of humanism, derived from the concept of Roman humanitas and the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy, such as that of Protagoras, who said that \"man is the measure of all things\". Early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the revived knowledge of how to make concrete. Although the invention of metal movable type sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century, the changes of the Renaissance were not uniform across Europe: the first traces appear in Italy as early as the late 13th century, in particular with the writings of Dante and the paintings of Giotto.\\nAs a cultural movement, the Renaissance encompassed innovative flowering of Latin and vernacular literatures, beginning with the 14th-century resurgence of learning based on classical sources, which contemporaries credited to Petrarch; the development of linear perspective and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality in painting; and gradual but widespread educational reform. In politics, the Renaissance contributed to the development of the customs and conventions of diplomacy, and in science to an increased reliance on observation and inductive reasoning. Although the Renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual and social scientific pursuits, as well as the introduction of modern banking and the field of accounting, it is perhaps best known for its artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, who inspired the term \"Renaissance man\".The Renaissance began in Florence, one of the many states of Italy. Various theories have been proposed to account for its origins and characteristics, focusing on a variety of factors, including Florence\\'s social and civic peculiarities at the time: its political structure, the patronage of its dominant family, the Medici, and the migration of Greek scholars and their texts to Italy following the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks. Other major centers were Venice, Genoa, Milan, Rome during the Renaissance Papacy, and Naples. From Italy, the Renaissance spread throughout Europe and also to American, African and Asian territories ruled by the European colonial powers of the time or where Christian missionaries were active. \\nThe Renaissance has a long and complex historiography, and in line with general skepticism of discrete periodizations, there has been much debate among historians reacting to the 19th-century glorification of the \"Renaissance\" and individual cultural heroes as \"Renaissance men\", questioning the usefulness of Renaissance as a term and as a historical delineation. Some observers have questioned whether the Renaissance was a cultural \"advance\" from the Middle Ages, instead seeing it as a period of pessimism and nostalgia for classical antiquity, while social and economic historians, especially of the longue durée, have instead focused on the continuity between the two eras, which are linked, as Panofsky observed, \"by a thousand ties\".The term rinascita (\"rebirth\") first appeared in Giorgio Vasari\\'s Lives of the Artists (c. 1550), anglicized as the Renaissance in the 1830s. The word has also been extended to other historical and cultural movements, such as the Carolingian Renaissance (8th and 9th centuries), Ottonian Renaissance (10th and 11th century), and the Renaissance of the 12th century.\\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\nThe Renaissance was a cultural movement that profoundly affected European intellectual life in the early modern period. Beginning in Italy, and spreading to the rest of Europe by the 16th century, its influence was felt in art, architecture, philosophy, literature, music, science, technology, politics, religion, and other aspects of intellectual inquiry. Renaissance scholars employed the humanist method in study, and searched for realism and human emotion in art.Renaissance humanists such as Poggio Bracciolini sought out in Europe\\'s monastic libraries the Latin literary, historical, and oratorical texts of antiquity, while the fall of Constantinople (1453) generated a wave of émigré Greek scholars bringing precious manuscripts in ancient Greek, many of which had fallen into obscurity in the West. It was in their new focus on literary and historical texts that Renaissance scholars differed so markedly from the medieval scholars of the Renaissance of the 12th century, who had focused on studying Greek and Arabic works of natural sciences, philosophy, and mathematics, rather than on such cultural texts.\\nIn the revival of neoplatonism, Renaissance humanists did not reject Christianity; on the contrary, many of the Renaissance\\'s greatest works were devoted to it, and the Church patronized many works of Renaissance art. But a subtle shift took place in the way that intellectuals approached religion that was reflected in many other areas of cultural life. In addition, many Greek Christian works, including the Greek New Testament, were brought back from Byzantium to Western Europe and engaged Western scholars for the first time since late antiquity. This new engagement with Greek Christian works, and particularly the return to the original Greek of the New Testament promoted by humanists Lorenzo Valla and Erasmus, helped pave the way for the Reformation.Well after the first artistic return to classicism had been exemplified in the sculpture of Nicola Pisano, Florentine painters led by Masaccio strove to portray the human form realistically, developing techniques to render perspective and light more naturally. Political philosophers, most famously Niccolò Machiavelli, sought to describe political life as it really was, that is to understand it rationally. A critical contribution to Italian Renaissance humanism, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola wrote De hominis dignitate (Oration on the Dignity of Man, 1486), a series of theses on philosophy, natural thought, faith, and magic defended against any opponent on the grounds of reason. In addition to studying classical Latin and Greek, Renaissance authors also began increasingly to use vernacular languages; combined with the introduction of the printing press, this allowed many more people access to books, especially the Bible.In all, the Renaissance can be viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the secular and worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity and through novel approaches to thought. Hans Kohn describes it as an age where \"Men looked for new foundations\"; some like Erasmus and Thomas More envisioned new reformed spiritual foundations, others. in the words of Machiavelli, una lunga sperienza delle cose moderne ed una continua lezione delle antiche (a long experience with modern life and a continuous learning from antiquity).Some scholars, such as Rodney Stark, play down the Renaissance in favor of the earlier innovations of the Italian city-states in the High Middle Ages, which married responsive government, Christianity and the birth of capitalism. This analysis argues that, whereas the great European states (France and Spain) were absolute monarchies, and others were under direct Church control, the independent city-republics of Italy took over the principles of capitalism invented on monastic estates and set off a vast unprecedented Commercial Revolution that preceded and financed the Renaissance.Leon Poliakov offers a critical view in his seminal study of European racist thought: The Aryan Myth.  According to Poliakov, the use of ethnic origin myths are first used by Renaissance humanists \"in the service of a new born chauvinism\".\\n\\n\\n== Origins ==\\n\\nMany argue that the ideas characterizing the Renaissance had their origin in Florence at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries, in particular with the writings of Dante Alighieri (1265–1321) and Petrarch (1304–1374), as well as the paintings of Giotto di Bondone (1267–1337). Some writers date the Renaissance quite precisely; one proposed starting point is 1401, when the rival geniuses Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi competed for the contract to build the bronze doors for the Baptistery of the Florence Cathedral (Ghiberti then won). Others see more general competition between artists and polymaths such as Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Donatello, and Masaccio for artistic commissions as sparking the creativity of the Renaissance.\\nYet it remains much debated why the Renaissance began in Italy, and why it began when it did. Accordingly, several theories have been put forward to explain its origins. Peter Rietbergen posits that various influential Proto-Renaissance movements started from roughly 1300 onwards across many regions of Europe.\\n\\n\\n=== Latin and Greek phases of Renaissance humanism ===\\n\\nIn stark contrast to the High Middle Ages, when Latin scholars focused almost entirely on studying Greek and Arabic works of natural science, philosophy and mathematics, Renaissance scholars were most interested in recovering and studying Latin and Greek literary, historical, and oratorical texts. Broadly speaking, this began in the 14th century with a Latin phase, when Renaissance scholars such as Petrarch, Coluccio Salutati (1331–1406), Niccolò de\\' Niccoli (1364–1437), and Poggio Bracciolini (1380–1459) scoured the libraries of Europe in search of works by such Latin authors as Cicero, Lucretius, Livy, and Seneca. By the early 15th century, the bulk of the surviving such Latin literature had been recovered; the Greek phase of Renaissance humanism was under way, as Western European scholars turned to recovering ancient Greek literary, historical, oratorical and theological texts.Unlike with Latin texts, which had been preserved and studied in Western Europe since late antiquity, the study of ancient Greek texts was very limited in medieval Western Europe. Ancient Greek works on science, mathematics, and philosophy had been studied since the High Middle Ages in Western Europe and in the Islamic Golden Age (normally in translation), but Greek literary, oratorical and historical works (such as Homer, the Greek dramatists, Demosthenes and Thucydides) were not studied in either the Latin or medieval Islamic worlds; in the Middle Ages these sorts of texts were only studied by Byzantine scholars. Some argue that the Timurid Renaissance in Samarkand and Herat, whose magnificence toned with Florence as the center of a cultural rebirth, were linked to the Ottoman Empire, whose conquests led to the migration of Greek scholars to Italian cities. One of the greatest achievements of Renaissance scholars was to bring this entire class of Greek cultural works back into Western Europe for the first time since late antiquity.\\nMuslim logicians, most notably Avicenna and Averroes, had inherited Greek ideas after they had invaded and conquered Egypt and the Levant. Their translations and commentaries on these ideas worked their way through the Arab West into Iberia and Sicily, which became important centers for this transmission of ideas. Between the 11th and 13th centuries, many schools dedicated to the translation of philosophical and scientific works from Classical Arabic to Medieval Latin were established in Iberia, most notably the Toledo School of Translators. This work of translation from Islamic culture, though largely unplanned and disorganized, constituted one of the greatest transmissions of ideas in history.The movement to reintegrate the regular study of Greek literary, historical, oratorical, and theological texts back into the Western European curriculum is usually dated to the 1396 invitation from Coluccio Salutati to the Byzantine diplomat and scholar Manuel Chrysoloras (c. 1355–1415) to teach Greek in Florence. This legacy was continued by a number of expatriate Greek scholars, from Basilios Bessarion to Leo Allatius.\\n\\n\\n=== Social and political structures in Italy ===\\nThe unique political structures of Italy during the Late Middle Ages have led some to theorize that its unusual social climate allowed the emergence of a rare cultural efflorescence. Italy did not exist as a political entity in the early modern period. Instead, it was divided into smaller city-states and territories: the Neapolitans controlled the south, the Florentines and the Romans at the center, the Milanese and the Genoese to the north and west respectively, and the Venetians to the east. 15th-century Italy was one of the most urbanized areas in Europe. Many of its cities stood among the ruins of ancient Roman buildings; it seems likely that the classical nature of the Renaissance was linked to its origin in the Roman Empire\\'s heartland.Historian and political philosopher Quentin Skinner points out that Otto of Freising (c. 1114–1158), a German bishop visiting north Italy during the 12th century, noticed a widespread new form of political and social organization, observing that Italy appeared to have exited from feudalism so that its society was based on merchants and commerce. Linked to this was anti-monarchical thinking, represented in the famous early Renaissance fresco cycle The Allegory of Good and Bad Government by Ambrogio Lorenzetti (painted 1338–1340), whose strong message is about the virtues of fairness, justice, republicanism and good administration. Holding both Church and Empire at bay, these city republics were devoted to notions of liberty. Skinner reports that there were many defences of liberty such as the Matteo Palmieri (1406–1475) celebration of Florentine genius not only in art, sculpture and architecture, but \"the remarkable efflorescence of moral, social and political philosophy that occurred in Florence at the same time\".Even cities and states beyond central Italy, such as the Republic of Florence at this time, were also notable for their merchant republics, especially the Republic of Venice. Although in practice these were oligarchical, and bore little resemblance to a modern democracy, they did have democratic features and were responsive states, with forms of participation in governance and belief in liberty. The relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement. Likewise, the position of Italian cities such as Venice as great trading centres made them intellectual crossroads. Merchants brought with them ideas from far corners of the globe, particularly the Levant. Venice was Europe\\'s gateway to trade with the East, and a producer of fine glass, while Florence was a capital of textiles. The wealth such business brought to Italy meant large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned and individuals had more leisure time for study.\\n\\n\\n=== Black Death ===\\n\\nOne theory that has been advanced is that the devastation in Florence caused by the Black Death, which hit Europe between 1348 and 1350, resulted in a shift in the world view of people in 14th century Italy. Italy was particularly badly hit by the plague, and it has been speculated that the resulting familiarity with death caused thinkers to dwell more on their lives on Earth, rather than on spirituality and the afterlife. It has also been argued that the Black Death prompted a new wave of piety, manifested in the sponsorship of religious works of art. However, this does not fully explain why the Renaissance occurred specifically in Italy in the 14th century. The Black Death was a pandemic that affected all of Europe in the ways described, not only Italy. The Renaissance\\'s emergence in Italy was most likely the result of the complex interaction of the above factors.The plague was carried by fleas on sailing vessels returning from the ports of Asia, spreading quickly due to lack of proper sanitation: the population of England, then about 4.2 million, lost 1.4 million people to the bubonic plague. Florence\\'s population was nearly halved in the year 1347. As a result of the decimation in the populace the value of the working class increased, and commoners came to enjoy more freedom. To answer the increased need for labor, workers traveled in search of the most favorable position economically.The demographic decline due to the plague had economic consequences: the prices of food dropped and land values declined by 30–40% in most parts of Europe between 1350 and 1400. Landholders faced a great loss, but for ordinary men and women it was a windfall. The survivors of the plague found not only that the prices of food were cheaper but also that lands were more abundant, and many of them inherited property from their dead relatives.\\nThe spread of disease was significantly more rampant in areas of poverty. Epidemics ravaged cities, particularly children. Plagues were easily spread by lice, unsanitary drinking water, armies, or by poor sanitation. Children were hit the hardest because many diseases, such as typhus and congenital syphilis, target the immune system, leaving young children without a fighting chance. Children in city dwellings were more affected by the spread of disease than the children of the wealthy.The Black Death caused greater upheaval to Florence\\'s social and political structure than later epidemics. Despite a significant number of deaths among members of the ruling classes, the government of Florence continued to function during this period. Formal meetings of elected representatives were suspended during the height of the epidemic due to the chaotic conditions in the city, but a small group of officials was appointed to conduct the affairs of the city, which ensured continuity of government.\\n\\n\\n=== Cultural conditions in Florence ===\\nIt has long been a matter of debate why the Renaissance began in Florence, and not elsewhere in Italy. Scholars have noted several features unique to Florentine cultural life that may have caused such a cultural movement. Many have emphasized the role played by the Medici, a banking family and later ducal ruling house, in patronizing and stimulating the arts. Lorenzo de\\' Medici (1449–1492) was the catalyst for an enormous amount of arts patronage, encouraging his countrymen to commission works from the leading artists of Florence, including Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, and Michelangelo Buonarroti. Works by Neri di Bicci, Botticelli, da Vinci, and Filippino Lippi had been commissioned additionally by the Convent of San Donato in Scopeto in Florence.The Renaissance was certainly underway before Lorenzo de\\' Medici came to power – indeed, before the Medici family itself achieved hegemony in Florentine society. Some historians have postulated that Florence was the birthplace of the Renaissance as a result of luck, i.e., because \"Great Men\" were born there by chance: Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli and Michelangelo were all born in Tuscany. Arguing that such chance seems improbable, other historians have contended that these \"Great Men\" were only able to rise to prominence because of the prevailing cultural conditions at the time.\\n\\n\\n== Characteristics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Humanism ===\\n\\nIn some ways, Renaissance humanism was not a philosophy but a method of learning. In contrast to the medieval scholastic mode, which focused on resolving contradictions between authors, Renaissance humanists would study ancient texts in the original and appraise them through a combination of reasoning and empirical evidence. Humanist education was based on the programme of Studia Humanitatis, the study of five humanities: poetry, grammar, history, moral philosophy, and rhetoric. Although historians have sometimes struggled to define humanism precisely, most have settled on \"a middle of the road definition... the movement to recover, interpret, and assimilate the language, literature, learning and values of ancient Greece and Rome\". Above all, humanists asserted \"the genius of man ... the unique and extraordinary ability of the human mind\".\\nHumanist scholars shaped the intellectual landscape throughout the early modern period. Political philosophers such as Niccolò Machiavelli and Thomas More revived the ideas of Greek and Roman thinkers and applied them in critiques of contemporary government, following the Islamic steps of Ibn Khaldun. Pico della Mirandola wrote the \"manifesto\" of the Renaissance, the Oration on the Dignity of Man, a vibrant defence of thinking. Matteo Palmieri (1406–1475), another humanist, is most known for his work Della vita civile (\"On Civic Life\"; printed 1528), which advocated civic humanism, and for his influence in refining the Tuscan vernacular to the same level as Latin. Palmieri drew on Roman philosophers and theorists, especially Cicero, who, like Palmieri, lived an active public life as a citizen and official, as well as a theorist and philosopher and also Quintilian. Perhaps the most succinct expression of his perspective on humanism is in a 1465 poetic work La città di vita, but an earlier work, Della vita civile, is more wide-ranging. Composed as a series of dialogues set in a country house in the Mugello countryside outside Florence during the plague of 1430, Palmieri expounds on the qualities of the ideal citizen. The dialogues include ideas about how children develop mentally and physically, how citizens can conduct themselves morally, how citizens and states can ensure probity in public life, and an important debate on the difference between that which is pragmatically useful and that which is honest.The humanists believed that it is important to transcend to the afterlife with a perfect mind and body, which could be attained with education. The purpose of humanism was to create a universal man whose person combined intellectual and physical excellence and who was capable of functioning honorably in virtually any situation. This ideology was referred to as the uomo universale, an ancient Greco-Roman ideal. Education during the Renaissance was mainly composed of ancient literature and history as it was thought that the classics provided moral instruction and an intensive understanding of human behavior.\\n\\n\\n=== Humanism and libraries ===\\nA unique characteristic of some Renaissance libraries is that they were open to the public. These libraries were places where ideas were exchanged and where scholarship and reading were considered both pleasurable and beneficial to the mind and soul. As freethinking was a hallmark of the age, many libraries contained a wide range of writers. Classical texts could be found alongside humanist writings. These informal associations of intellectuals profoundly influenced Renaissance culture. Some of the richest \"bibliophiles\" built libraries as temples to books and knowledge. A number of libraries appeared as manifestations of immense wealth joined with a love of books. In some cases, cultivated library builders were also committed to offering others the opportunity to use their collections. Prominent aristocrats and princes of the Church created great libraries for the use of their courts, called \"court libraries\", and were housed in lavishly designed monumental buildings decorated with ornate woodwork, and the walls adorned with frescoes (Murray, Stuart A.P.).\\n\\n\\n=== Art ===\\n\\nRenaissance art marks a cultural rebirth at the close of the Middle Ages and rise of the Modern world. One of the distinguishing features of Renaissance art was its development of highly realistic linear perspective. Giotto di Bondone (1267–1337) is credited with first treating a painting as a window into space, but it was not until the demonstrations of architect Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1446) and the subsequent writings of Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472) that perspective was formalized as an artistic technique.\\nThe development of perspective was part of a wider trend toward realism in the arts. Painters developed other techniques, studying light, shadow, and, famously in the case of Leonardo da Vinci, human anatomy. Underlying these changes in artistic method was a renewed desire to depict the beauty of nature and to unravel the axioms of aesthetics, with the works of Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael representing artistic pinnacles that were much imitated by other artists. Other notable artists include Sandro Botticelli, working for the Medici in Florence, Donatello, another Florentine, and Titian in Venice, among others.\\nIn the Netherlands, a particularly vibrant artistic culture developed. The work of Hugo van der Goes and Jan van Eyck was particularly influential on the development of painting in Italy, both technically with the introduction of oil paint and canvas, and stylistically in terms of naturalism in representation. Later, the work of Pieter Brueghel the Elder would inspire artists to depict themes of everyday life.In architecture, Filippo Brunelleschi was foremost in studying the remains of ancient classical buildings. With rediscovered knowledge from the 1st-century writer Vitruvius and the flourishing discipline of mathematics, Brunelleschi formulated the Renaissance style that emulated and improved on classical forms. His major feat of engineering was building the dome of the Florence Cathedral. Another building demonstrating this style is the church of St. Andrew in Mantua, built by Alberti. The outstanding architectural work of the High Renaissance was the rebuilding of St. Peter\\'s Basilica, combining the skills of Bramante, Michelangelo, Raphael, Sangallo and Maderno.\\nDuring the Renaissance, architects aimed to use columns, pilasters, and entablatures as an integrated system. The Roman orders types of columns are used: Tuscan and Composite. These can either be structural, supporting an arcade or architrave, or purely decorative, set against a wall in the form of pilasters. One of the first buildings to use pilasters as an integrated system was in the Old Sacristy (1421–1440) by Brunelleschi. Arches, semi-circular or (in the Mannerist style) segmental, are often used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals. There may be a section of entablature between the capital and the springing of the arch. Alberti was one of the first to use the arch on a monumental. Renaissance vaults do not have ribs; they are semi-circular or segmental and on a square plan, unlike the Gothic vault, which is frequently rectangular.\\nRenaissance artists were not pagans, although they admired antiquity and kept some ideas and symbols of the medieval past. Nicola Pisano (c. 1220 – c. 1278) imitated classical forms by portraying scenes from the Bible. His Annunciation, from the Baptistry at Pisa, demonstrates that classical models influenced Italian art before the Renaissance took root as a literary movement.\\n\\n\\n=== Science ===\\n\\nApplied innovation extended to commerce. At the end of the 15th century, Luca Pacioli published the first work on bookkeeping, making him the founder of accounting.The rediscovery of ancient texts and the invention of the printing press in about 1440 democratized learning and allowed a faster propagation of more widely distributed ideas. In the first period of the Italian Renaissance, humanists favored the study of humanities over natural philosophy or applied mathematics, and their reverence for classical sources further enshrined the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic views of the universe. Writing around 1450, Nicholas Cusanus anticipated the heliocentric worldview of Copernicus, but in a philosophical fashion.\\nScience and art were intermingled in the early Renaissance, with polymath artists such as Leonardo da Vinci making observational drawings of anatomy and nature. Leonardo set up controlled experiments in water flow, medical dissection, and systematic study of movement and aerodynamics, and he devised principles of research method that led Fritjof Capra to classify him as the \"father of modern science\". Other examples of Da Vinci\\'s contribution during this period include machines designed to saw marbles and lift monoliths, and new discoveries in acoustics, botany, geology, anatomy, and mechanics.A suitable environment had developed to question classical scientific doctrine. The discovery in 1492 of the New World by Christopher Columbus challenged the classical worldview. The works of Ptolemy (in geography) and Galen (in medicine) were found to not always match everyday observations. As the Reformation and Counter-Reformation clashed, the Northern Renaissance showed a decisive shift in focus from Aristotelean natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine). The willingness to question previously held truths and search for new answers resulted in a period of major scientific advancements.\\nSome view this as a \"scientific revolution\", heralding the beginning of the modern age, others as an acceleration of a continuous process stretching from the ancient world to the present day. Significant scientific advances were made during this time by Galileo Galilei, Tycho Brahe, and Johannes Kepler. Copernicus, in De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres), posited that the Earth moved around the Sun. De humani corporis fabrica (On the Workings of the Human Body) by Andreas Vesalius, gave a new confidence to the role of dissection, observation, and the mechanistic view of anatomy.Another important development was in the process for discovery, the scientific method, focusing on empirical evidence and the importance of mathematics, while discarding much of Aristotelian science. Early and influential proponents of these ideas included Copernicus, Galileo, and Francis Bacon. The new scientific method led to great contributions in the fields of astronomy, physics, biology, and anatomy.\\n\\n\\n=== Navigation and geography ===\\n\\nDuring the Renaissance, extending from 1450 to 1650, every continent was visited and mostly mapped by Europeans, except the south polar continent now known as Antarctica. This development is depicted in the large world map Nova Totius Terrarum Orbis Tabula made by the Dutch cartographer Joan Blaeu in 1648 to commemorate the Peace of Westphalia.\\nIn 1492, Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean from Spain seeking a direct route to India of the Delhi Sultanate. He accidentally stumbled upon the Americas, but believed he had reached the East Indies.\\nIn 1606, the Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon sailed from the East Indies in the VOC ship Duyfken and landed in Australia. He charted about 300 km of the west coast of Cape York Peninsula in Queensland. More than thirty Dutch expeditions followed, mapping sections of the north, west, and south coasts. In 1642–1643, Abel Tasman circumnavigated the continent, proving that it was not joined to the imagined south polar continent.\\nBy 1650, Dutch cartographers had mapped most of the coastline of the continent, which they named New Holland, except the east coast which was charted in 1770 by James Cook.\\nThe long-imagined south polar continent was eventually sighted in 1820. Throughout the Renaissance it had been known as Terra Australis, or \\'Australia\\' for short. However, after that name was transferred to New Holland in the nineteenth century, the new name of \\'Antarctica\\' was bestowed on the south polar continent.\\n\\n\\n=== Music ===\\n\\nFrom this changing society emerged a common, unifying musical language, in particular the polyphonic style of the Franco-Flemish school. The development of printing made distribution of music possible on a wide scale. Demand for music as entertainment and as an activity for educated amateurs increased with the emergence of a bourgeois class. Dissemination of chansons, motets, and masses throughout Europe coincided with the unification of polyphonic practice into the fluid style that culminated in the second half of the sixteenth century in the work of composers such as Palestrina, Lassus, Victoria, and William Byrd.\\n\\n\\n=== Religion ===\\n\\nThe new ideals of humanism, although more secular in some aspects, developed against a Christian backdrop, especially in the Northern Renaissance. Much, if not most, of the new art was commissioned by or in dedication to the Church. However, the Renaissance had a profound effect on contemporary theology, particularly in the way people perceived the relationship between man and God. Many of the period\\'s foremost theologians were followers of the humanist method, including Erasmus, Huldrych Zwingli, Thomas More, Martin Luther, and John Calvin.\\n\\nThe Renaissance began in times of religious turmoil. The Late Middle Ages was a period of political intrigue surrounding the Papacy, culminating in the Western Schism, in which three men simultaneously claimed to be true Bishop of Rome. While the schism was resolved by the Council of Constance (1414), a resulting reform movement known as Conciliarism sought to limit the power of the pope. Although the papacy eventually emerged supreme in ecclesiastical matters by the Fifth Council of the Lateran (1511), it was dogged by continued accusations of corruption, most famously in the person of Pope Alexander VI, who was accused variously of simony, nepotism, and fathering children (most of whom were married off, presumably for the consolidation of power) while a cardinal.Churchmen such as Erasmus and Luther proposed reform to the Church, often based on humanist textual criticism of the New Testament. In October 1517, Luther published the Ninety-five Theses, challenging papal authority and criticizing its perceived corruption, particularly with regard to instances of sold indulgences. The 95 Theses led to the Reformation, a break with the Roman Catholic Church that previously claimed hegemony in Western Europe. Humanism and the Renaissance therefore played a direct role in sparking the Reformation, as well as in many other contemporaneous religious debates and conflicts.\\nPope Paul III came to the papal throne (1534–1549) after the sack of Rome in 1527, with uncertainties prevalent in the Catholic Church following the Reformation. Nicolaus Copernicus dedicated De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres) to Paul III, who became the grandfather of Alessandro Farnese, who had paintings by Titian, Michelangelo, and Raphael, as well as an important collection of drawings, and who commissioned the masterpiece of Giulio Clovio, arguably the last major illuminated manuscript, the Farnese Hours.\\n\\n\\n=== Self-awareness ===\\nBy the 15th century, writers, artists, and architects in Italy were well aware of the transformations that were taking place and were using phrases such as modi antichi (in the antique manner) or alle romana et alla antica (in the manner of the Romans and the ancients) to describe their work. In the 1330s Petrarch referred to pre-Christian times as antiqua (ancient) and to the Christian period as nova (new). From Petrarch\\'s Italian perspective, this new period (which included his own time) was an age of national eclipse.Leonardo Bruni was the first to use tripartite periodization in his History of the Florentine People (1442). Bruni\\'s first two periods were based on those of Petrarch, but he added a third period because he believed that Italy was no longer in a state of decline. Flavio Biondo used a similar framework in Decades of History from the Deterioration of the Roman Empire (1439–1453).\\nHumanist historians argued that contemporary scholarship restored direct links to the classical period, thus bypassing the Medieval period, which they then named for the first time the \"Middle Ages\". The term first appears in Latin in 1469 as media tempestas (middle times). The term rinascita (rebirth) first appeared, however, in its broad sense in Giorgio Vasari\\'s Lives of the Artists, 1550, revised 1568. Vasari divides the age into three phases: the first phase contains Cimabue, Giotto, and Arnolfo di Cambio; the second phase contains Masaccio, Brunelleschi, and Donatello; the third centers on Leonardo da Vinci and culminates with Michelangelo. It was not just the growing awareness of classical antiquity that drove this development, according to Vasari, but also the growing desire to study and imitate nature.\\n\\n\\n== Spread ==\\nIn the 15th century, the Renaissance spread rapidly from its birthplace in Florence to the rest of Italy and soon to the rest of Europe. The invention of the printing press by German printer Johannes Gutenberg allowed the rapid transmission of these new ideas. As it spread, its ideas diversified and changed, being adapted to local culture. In the 20th century, scholars began to break the Renaissance into regional and national movements.\\n\\n\\n=== England ===\\n\\nRenaissance style and ideas were slow to penetrate England, and the Elizabethan era in the second half of the 16th century is usually regarded as the height of the English Renaissance. Many scholars see its beginnings in the early 16th century during the reign of Henry VIII.The English Renaissance is different from the Italian Renaissance in several ways. The dominant art forms of the English Renaissance were literature and music. Visual arts in the English Renaissance were much less significant than in the Italian Renaissance. The English Renaissance period in art began far later than the Italian, which had moved into Mannerism by the 1530s.\\nIn literature the later part of the 16th century saw the flowering of Elizabethan literature, with poetry heavily influenced by Italian Renaissance literature but Elizabethan theatre a distinctive native style. Writers include William Shakespeare (1564–1616), Christopher Marlowe (1564–593), Edmund Spenser (1552/1553–599), Sir Thomas More (1478–1535), Francis Bacon (1561–1626), and Sir Philip Sidney (1554–1586). English Renaissance music competed with that in Europe with composers such as Thomas Tallis (1505–1585), John Taverner (c. 1490–1545), and William Byrd (c. 1539/40 or 1543–1623).  Elizabethan architecture produced the large prodigy houses of courtiers, and in the next century Inigo Jones (1573–1652), who introduced Italianate architecture to England.\\n\\n\\n=== France ===\\n\\nThe word \"Renaissance\" is borrowed from the French language, where it means \"re-birth\". It was first used in the eighteenth century and was later popularized by French historian Jules Michelet (1798–1874) in his 1855 work, Histoire de France (History of France).In 1495 the Italian Renaissance arrived in France, imported by King Charles VIII after his invasion of Italy. A factor that promoted the spread of secularism was the inability of the Church to offer assistance against the Black Death. Francis I imported Italian art and artists, including Leonardo da Vinci, and built ornate palaces at great expense. Writers such as François Rabelais, Pierre de Ronsard, Joachim du Bellay, and Michel de Montaigne, painters such as Jean Clouet, and musicians such as Jean Mouton also borrowed from the spirit of the Renaissance.\\nIn 1533, a fourteen-year-old Caterina de\\' Medici (1519–1589), born in Florence to Lorenzo de\\' Medici, Duke of Urbino and Madeleine de la Tour d\\'Auvergne, married Henry II of France, second son of King Francis I and Queen Claude. Though she became famous and infamous for her role in France\\'s religious wars, she made a direct contribution in bringing arts, sciences, and music (including the origins of ballet) to the French court from her native Florence.\\n\\n\\n=== Germany ===\\n\\nIn the second half of the 15th century, the Renaissance spirit spread to Germany and the Low Countries, where the development of the printing press (ca. 1450) and Renaissance artists such as Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) predated the influence from Italy. In the early Protestant areas of the country humanism became closely linked to the turmoil of the Reformation, and the art and writing of the German Renaissance frequently reflected this dispute. However, the Gothic style and medieval scholastic philosophy remained exclusively until the turn of the 16th century. Emperor Maximilian I of Habsburg (ruling 1493–1519) was the first truly Renaissance monarch of the Holy Roman Empire.\\n\\n\\n=== Hungarian trecento and quattrocento ===\\n\\nAfter Italy, Hungary was the first European country where the Renaissance appeared. The Renaissance style came directly from Italy during the Quattrocento (1400s) to Hungary first in the Central European region, thanks to the development of early Hungarian-Italian relationships — not only in dynastic connections, but also in cultural, humanistic and commercial relations – growing in strength from the 14th century. The relationship between Hungarian and Italian Gothic styles was a second reason – exaggerated breakthrough of walls is avoided, preferring clean and light structures. Large-scale building schemes provided ample and long term work for the artists, for example, the building of the Friss (New) Castle in Buda, the castles of Visegrád, Tata, and Várpalota. In Sigismund\\'s court there were patrons such as Pipo Spano, a descendant of the Scolari family of Florence, who invited Manetto Ammanatini and Masolino da Pannicale to Hungary.The new Italian trend combined with existing national traditions to create a particular local Renaissance art. Acceptance of Renaissance art was furthered by the continuous arrival of humanist thought in the country. Many young Hungarians studying at Italian universities came closer to the Florentine humanist center, so a direct connection with Florence evolved. The growing number of Italian traders moving to Hungary, specially to Buda, helped this process. New thoughts were carried by the humanist prelates, among them Vitéz János, archbishop of Esztergom, one of the founders of Hungarian humanism. During the long reign of emperor Sigismund of Luxemburg the Royal Castle of Buda became probably the largest Gothic palace of the late Middle Ages. King Matthias Corvinus (r. 1458–1490) rebuilt the palace in early Renaissance style and further expanded it.After the marriage in 1476 of King Matthias to Beatrice of Naples, Buda became one of the most important artistic centers of the Renaissance north of the Alps. The most important humanists living in Matthias\\' court were Antonio Bonfini and the famous Hungarian poet Janus Pannonius. András Hess set up a printing press in Buda in 1472. Matthias Corvinus\\'s library, the Bibliotheca Corviniana, was Europe\\'s greatest collections of secular books: historical chronicles, philosophic and scientific works in the 15th century. His library was second only in size to the Vatican Library. (However, the Vatican Library mainly contained Bibles and religious materials.) In 1489, Bartolomeo della Fonte of Florence wrote that Lorenzo de\\' Medici founded his own Greek-Latin library encouraged by the example of the Hungarian king. Corvinus\\'s library is part of UNESCO World Heritage.Matthias started at least two major building projects. The works in Buda and Visegrád began in about 1479. Two new wings and a hanging garden were built at the royal castle of Buda, and the palace at Visegrád was rebuilt in Renaissance style. Matthias appointed the Italian Chimenti Camicia and the Dalmatian Giovanni Dalmata to direct these projects.  Matthias commissioned the leading Italian artists of his age to embellish his palaces: for instance, the sculptor Benedetto da Majano and the painters Filippino Lippi and Andrea Mantegna worked for him. A copy of Mantegna\\'s portrait of Matthias survived. Matthias also hired the Italian military engineer Aristotele Fioravanti to direct the rebuilding of the forts along the southern frontier. He had new monasteries built in Late Gothic style for the Franciscans in Kolozsvár, Szeged and Hunyad, and for the Paulines in Fejéregyháza.  In the spring of 1485, Leonardo da Vinci travelled to Hungary on behalf of Sforza to meet king Matthias Corvinus, and was commissioned by him to paint a Madonna.Matthias enjoyed the company of Humanists and had lively discussions on various topics with them. The fame of his magnanimity encouraged many scholars—mostly Italian—to settle in Buda. Antonio Bonfini, Pietro Ranzano, Bartolomeo Fonzio, and Francesco Bandini spent many years in Matthias\\'s court. This circle of educated men introduced the ideas of Neoplatonism to Hungary. Like all intellectuals of his age, Matthias was convinced that the movements and combinations of the stars and planets exercised influence on individuals\\' life and on the history of nations. Galeotto Marzio described him as \"king and astrologer\", and Antonio Bonfini said Matthias \"never did anything without consulting the stars\". Upon his request, the famous astronomers of the age, Johannes Regiomontanus and Marcin Bylica, set up an observatory in Buda and installed it with astrolabes and celestial globes. Regiomontanus dedicated his book on navigation that was used by Christopher Columbus to Matthias.Other important figures of Hungarian Renaissance include Bálint Balassi (poet), Sebestyén Tinódi Lantos (poet), Bálint Bakfark (composer and lutenist), and Master MS (fresco painter).\\n\\n\\n=== Renaissance in the Low Countries ===\\n\\nCulture in the Netherlands at the end of the 15th century was influenced by the Italian Renaissance through trade via Bruges, which made Flanders wealthy. Its nobles commissioned artists who became known across Europe. In science, the anatomist Andreas Vesalius led the way; in cartography, Gerardus Mercator\\'s map assisted explorers and navigators. In art, Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting ranged from the strange work of Hieronymus Bosch to the everyday life depictions of Pieter Brueghel the Elder.Erasmus was arguably the Netherlands\\' best known humanist and Catholic intellectual during the Renaissance.\\n\\n\\n=== Northern Europe ===\\n\\nThe Renaissance in Northern Europe has been termed the \"Northern Renaissance\". While Renaissance ideas were moving north from Italy, there was a simultaneous southward spread of some areas of innovation, particularly in music. The music of the 15th-century Burgundian School defined the beginning of the Renaissance in music, and the polyphony of the Netherlanders, as it moved with the musicians themselves into Italy, formed the core of the first true international style in music since the standardization of Gregorian Chant in the 9th century. The culmination of the Netherlandish school was in the music of the Italian composer Palestrina. At the end of the 16th century Italy again became a center of musical innovation, with the development of the polychoral style of the Venetian School, which spread northward into Germany around 1600. In Denmark, the Renaissance sparked the translation of the works of Saxo Grammaticus into Danish as well as Frederick II and Christian IV ordering the redecoration or construction of several important works of architecture, i.e. Kronborg, Rosenborg and Børsen. Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe greatly contributed to turn astronomy into the first modern science and also helped launch the Scientific Revolution.The paintings of the Italian Renaissance differed from those of the Northern Renaissance. Italian Renaissance artists were among the first to paint secular scenes, breaking away from the purely religious art of medieval painters. Northern Renaissance artists initially remained focused on religious subjects, such as the contemporary religious upheaval portrayed by Albrecht Dürer. Later, the works of Pieter Bruegel influenced artists to paint scenes of daily life rather than religious or classical themes. It was also during the Northern Renaissance that Flemish brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck perfected the oil painting technique, which enabled artists to produce strong colors on a hard surface that could survive for centuries. A feature of the Northern Renaissance was its use of the vernacular in place of Latin or Greek, which allowed greater freedom of expression. This movement had started in Italy with the decisive influence of Dante Alighieri on the development of vernacular languages; in fact the focus on writing in Italian has neglected a major source of Florentine ideas expressed in Latin. The spread of the printing press technology boosted the Renaissance in Northern Europe as elsewhere, with Venice becoming a world center of printing.\\n\\n\\n=== Poland ===\\n\\nAn early Italian humanist who came to Poland in the mid-15th century was Filippo Buonaccorsi. Many Italian artists came to Poland with Bona Sforza of Milan, when she married King Sigismund I in 1518. This was supported by temporarily strengthened monarchies in both areas, as well as by newly established universities. The Polish Renaissance lasted from the late 15th to the late 16th century and was the Golden Age of Polish culture. Ruled by the Jagiellonian dynasty, the Kingdom of Poland (from 1569 known as the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) actively participated in the broad European Renaissance. The multi-national Polish state experienced a substantial period of cultural growth thanks in part to a century without major wars – aside from conflicts in the sparsely populated eastern and southern borderlands. The Reformation spread peacefully throughout the country (giving rise to the Polish Brethren), while living conditions improved, cities grew, and exports of agricultural products enriched the population, especially the nobility (szlachta) who gained dominance in the new political system of Golden Liberty. The Polish Renaissance architecture has three periods of development.\\nThe greatest monument of this style in the territory of the former Duchy of Pomerania is the Ducal Castle in Szczecin.\\n\\n\\n=== Portugal ===\\n\\nAlthough Italian Renaissance had a modest impact in Portuguese arts, Portugal was influential in broadening the European worldview, stimulating humanist inquiry. Renaissance arrived through the influence of wealthy Italian and Flemish merchants who invested in the profitable commerce overseas. As the pioneer headquarters of European exploration, Lisbon flourished in the late 15th century, attracting experts who made several breakthroughs in mathematics, astronomy and naval technology, including Pedro Nunes, João de Castro, Abraham Zacuto, and Martin Behaim. Cartographers Pedro Reinel, Lopo Homem, Estêvão Gomes, and Diogo Ribeiro made crucial advances in mapping the world. Apothecary Tomé Pires and physicians Garcia de Orta and Cristóvão da Costa collected and published works on plants and medicines, soon translated by Flemish pioneer botanist Carolus Clusius.\\n\\nIn architecture, the huge profits of the spice trade financed a sumptuous composite style in the first decades of the 16th century, the Manueline, incorporating maritime elements. The primary painters were Nuno Gonçalves, Gregório Lopes, and Vasco Fernandes. In music, Pedro de Escobar and Duarte Lobo produced four songbooks, including the Cancioneiro de Elvas. In literature, Sá de Miranda introduced Italian forms of verse. Bernardim Ribeiro developed pastoral romance, plays by Gil Vicente fused it with popular culture, reporting the changing times, and Luís de Camões inscribed the Portuguese feats overseas in the epic poem Os Lusíadas. Travel literature especially flourished: João de Barros, Castanheda, António Galvão, Gaspar Correia, Duarte Barbosa, and Fernão Mendes Pinto, among others, described new lands and were translated and spread with the new printing press. After joining the Portuguese exploration of Brazil in 1500, Amerigo Vespucci coined the term New World, in his letters to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de\\' Medici.\\nThe intense international exchange produced several cosmopolitan humanist scholars, including Francisco de Holanda, André de Resende, and Damião de Góis, a friend of Erasmus who wrote with rare independence on the reign of King Manuel I. Diogo and André de Gouveia made relevant teaching reforms via France. Foreign news and products in the Portuguese factory in Antwerp attracted the interest of Thomas More and Albrecht Dürer to the wider world. There, profits and know-how helped nurture the Dutch Renaissance and Golden Age, especially after the arrival of the wealthy cultured Jewish community expelled from Portugal.\\n\\n\\n=== Spain ===\\n\\nThe Renaissance arrived in the Iberian peninsula through the Mediterranean possessions of the Aragonese Crown and the city of Valencia. Many early Spanish Renaissance writers come from the Kingdom of Aragon, including Ausiàs March and Joanot Martorell. In the Kingdom of Castile, the early Renaissance was heavily influenced by the Italian humanism, starting with writers and poets such as the Marquis of Santillana, who introduced the new Italian poetry to Spain in the early 15th century. Other writers, such as Jorge Manrique, Fernando de Rojas, Juan del Encina, Juan Boscán Almogáver, and Garcilaso de la Vega, kept a close resemblance to the Italian canon. Miguel de Cervantes\\'s masterpiece Don Quixote is credited as the first Western novel. Renaissance humanism flourished in the early 16th century, with influential writers such as philosopher Juan Luis Vives, grammarian Antonio de Nebrija and natural historian Pedro de Mexía.\\nLater Spanish Renaissance tended toward religious themes and mysticism, with poets such as Luis de León, Teresa of Ávila, and John of the Cross, and treated issues related to the exploration of the New World, with chroniclers and writers such as Inca Garcilaso de la Vega and Bartolomé de las Casas, giving rise to a body of work, now known as Spanish Renaissance literature. The late Renaissance in Spain produced artists such as El Greco and composers such as Tomás Luis de Victoria and Antonio de Cabezón.\\n\\n\\n=== Further countries ===\\nRenaissance in Croatia\\nRenaissance in Scotland\\n\\n\\n== Historiography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Conception ===\\nThe Italian artist and critic Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574) first used the term rinascita in his book The Lives of the Artists (published 1550). In the book Vasari attempted to define what he described as a break with the barbarities of Gothic art: the arts (he held) had fallen into decay with the collapse of the Roman Empire and only the Tuscan artists, beginning with Cimabue (1240–1301) and Giotto (1267–1337) began to reverse this decline in the arts. Vasari saw ancient art as central to the rebirth of Italian art.However, only in the 19th century did the French word renaissance achieve popularity in describing the self-conscious cultural movement based on revival of Roman models that began in the late 13th century. French historian Jules Michelet (1798–1874) defined \"The Renaissance\" in his 1855 work Histoire de France as an entire historical period, whereas previously it had been used in a more limited sense. For Michelet, the Renaissance was more a development in science than in art and culture. He asserted that it spanned the period from Columbus to Copernicus to Galileo; that is, from the end of the 15th century to the middle of the 17th century. Moreover, Michelet distinguished between what he called, \"the bizarre and monstrous\" quality of the Middle Ages and the democratic values that he, as a vocal Republican, chose to see in its character. A French nationalist, Michelet also sought to claim the Renaissance as a French movement.The Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt (1818–1897) in his The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy (1860), by contrast, defined the Renaissance as the period between Giotto and Michelangelo in Italy, that is, the 14th to mid-16th centuries. He saw in the Renaissance the emergence of the modern spirit of individuality, which the Middle Ages had stifled. His book was widely read and became influential in the development of the modern interpretation of the Italian Renaissance.More recently, some historians have been much less keen to define the Renaissance as a historical age, or even as a coherent cultural movement. The historian Randolph Starn, of the University of California Berkeley, stated in 1998:\\n\\nRather than a period with definitive beginnings and endings and consistent content in between, the Renaissance can be (and occasionally has been) seen as a movement of practices and ideas to which specific groups and identifiable persons variously responded in different times and places. It would be in this sense a network of diverse, sometimes converging, sometimes conflicting cultures, not a single, time-bound culture.\\n\\n\\n=== Debates about progress ===\\n\\nThere is debate about the extent to which the Renaissance improved on the culture of the Middle Ages. Both Michelet and Burckhardt were keen to describe the progress made in the Renaissance toward the modern age. Burckhardt likened the change to a veil being removed from man\\'s eyes, allowing him to see clearly.\\nIn the Middle Ages both sides of human consciousness – that which was turned within as that which was turned without – lay dreaming or half awake beneath a common veil. The veil was woven of faith, illusion, and childish prepossession, through which the world and history were seen clad in strange hues.\\nOn the other hand, many historians now point out that most of the negative social factors popularly associated with the medieval period – poverty, warfare, religious and political persecution, for example – seem to have worsened in this era, which saw the rise of Machiavellian politics, the Wars of Religion, the corrupt Borgia Popes, and the intensified witch-hunts of the 16th century. Many people who lived during the Renaissance did not view it as the \"golden age\" imagined by certain 19th-century authors, but were concerned by these social maladies. Significantly, though, the artists, writers, and patrons involved in the cultural movements in question believed they were living in a new era that was a clean break from the Middle Ages. Some Marxist historians prefer to describe the Renaissance in material terms, holding the view that the changes in art, literature, and philosophy were part of a general economic trend from feudalism toward capitalism, resulting in a bourgeois class with leisure time to devote to the arts.Johan Huizinga (1872–1945) acknowledged the existence of the Renaissance but questioned whether it was a positive change. In his book The Autumn of the Middle Ages, he argued that the Renaissance was a period of decline from the High Middle Ages, destroying much that was important. The Medieval Latin language, for instance, had evolved greatly from the classical period and was still a living language used in the church and elsewhere. The Renaissance obsession with classical purity halted its further evolution and saw Latin revert to its classical form. This view is however somewhat contested by recent studies. Robert S. Lopez has contended that it was a period of deep economic recession. Meanwhile, George Sarton and Lynn Thorndike have both argued that scientific progress was perhaps less original than has traditionally been supposed. Finally, Joan Kelly argued that the Renaissance led to greater gender dichotomy, lessening the agency women had had during the Middle Ages.Some historians have begun to consider the word Renaissance to be unnecessarily loaded, implying an unambiguously positive rebirth from the supposedly more primitive \"Dark Ages\", the Middle Ages. Most political and economic historians now prefer to use the term \"early modern\" for this period (and a considerable period afterwards), a designation intended to highlight the period as a transitional one between the Middle Ages and the modern era. Others such as Roger Osborne have come to consider the Italian Renaissance as a repository of the myths and ideals of western history in general, and instead of rebirth of ancient ideas as a period of great innovation.The art historian Erwin Panofsky observed of this resistance to the concept of \"Renaissance\":\\n\\nIt is perhaps no accident that the factuality of the Italian Renaissance has been most vigorously questioned by those who are not obliged to take a professional interest in the aesthetic aspects of civilization – historians of economic and social developments, political and religious situations, and, most particularly, natural science – but only exceptionally by students of literature and hardly ever by historians of Art.\\n\\n\\n== Other Renaissances ==\\nThe term Renaissance has also been used to define periods outside of the 15th and 16th centuries. Charles H. Haskins (1870–1937), for example, made a case for a Renaissance of the 12th century. Other historians have argued for a Carolingian Renaissance in the 8th and 9th centuries, Ottonian Renaissance in the 10th century and for the Timurid Renaissance of the 14th century. The Islamic Golden Age has been also sometimes termed with the Islamic Renaissance. The Macedonian Renaissance is a term used for a period in the Roman Empire in the 9th-11th centuries CE. \\nOther periods of cultural rebirth have also been termed \"renaissances\", such as the Bengal Renaissance, Tamil Renaissance, Nepal Bhasa renaissance, al-Nahda or the Harlem Renaissance. The term can also be used in cinema. In animation, the Disney Renaissance is a period that spanned the years from 1989 to 1999 which saw the studio return to the level of quality not witnessed since their Golden Age of Animation. The San Francisco Renaissance was a vibrant period of exploratory poetry and fiction writing in that city in the mid-20th century.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nIndex of Renaissance articles\\nOutline of the Renaissance\\nList of Renaissance figures\\nList of Renaissance structures\\nRoman Renaissance\\nVenetian Renaissance\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Explanatory notes ===\\n\\n\\n=== Citations ===\\n\\n\\n=== General sources ===\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\\n\\n=== Historiography ===\\n\\n\\n=== Primary sources ===\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\n\"The Renaissance\" episode of In Our Time, a BBC Radio 4 discussion with Francis Ames-Lewis, Peter Burke and Evelyn Welch (June 8, 2000).\\nSymonds, John Addington (1911). \"Renaissance, The\" .
