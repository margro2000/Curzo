Cargle\\n\\n<b>From a highly lauded modern voice in feminism and racial justice comes a deeply personal and insightful testament to the power of reimagining to dismantle the frameworks and systems that no longer serve us while building new ones that do.<br><br>“Powerful . . . You will leave these pages changed for the better.”—Gabrielle Union, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>We’re Going to Need More Wine</i> </b><br><br>There are breaking points in all our lives when we realize that the way things have been done before just don’t work for us anymore, be it the way we approach our relationships, our belief systems, our work, our education, even our rest. For activist, philanthropist, and CEO Rachel E. Cargle, reimagining—the act of creating in our minds that which does not exist but that we believe <i>can</i> and <i>should</i>—has been a lifelong process. Reimagining served as the most powerful catalyst for Cargle’s personal transformation from a small-town Christian wife to an incisive queer feminist voice of a generation.<br><br> In <i>A Renaissance of Our Own,</i> we witness the sometimes painful but always inspiring breaking points in Cargle’s life that fostered a truer identity. These defining moments offer a blueprint for how we must all use our imagination—the space that sees beyond limits—to live in alignment with our highest values and to craft a world independent of oppressive structures, both personal and societal.\\xa0Cargle now invites you to acknowledge ways of being that stem from societal expectations instead of your personal truth, and to embark on a renaissance of your own. She provides the very tools and prompts that she used to unearth her own truth, tools that opened her up to being a more authentic feminist and purpose-driven matriarchal leader.\\xa0<br> <i><br>A Renaissance of Our Own</i> gives us the courage to look at the world and say “I want something different.” It serves as a reminder of the power and possibility of reimagining a life that feels right, all the way down to the marrow of your bones.',\n",

       "    'html_description': 'Author(s): Rachel E. Cargle<br/>Narrator(s): Rachel E. Cargle<br/>&lt;b&gt;From a highly lauded modern voice in feminism and racial justice comes a deeply personal and insightful testament to the power of reimagining to dismantle the frameworks and systems that no longer serve us while building new ones that do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Powerful . . . You will leave these pages changed for the better.”—Gabrielle Union, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;We’re Going to Need More Wine&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are breaking points in all our lives when we realize that the way things have been done before just don’t work for us anymore, be it the way we approach our relationships, our belief systems, our work, our education, even our rest. For activist, philanthropist, and CEO Rachel E. Cargle, reimagining—the act of creating in our minds that which does not exist but that we believe &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt;—has been a lifelong process. Reimagining served as the most powerful catalyst for Cargle’s personal transformation from a small-town Christian wife to an incisive queer feminist voice of a generation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In &lt;i&gt;A Renaissance of Our Own,&lt;/i&gt; we witness the sometimes painful but always inspiring breaking points in Cargle’s life that fostered a truer identity. These defining moments offer a blueprint for how we must all use our imagination—the space that sees beyond limits—to live in alignment with our highest values and to craft a world independent of oppressive structures, both personal and societal.\\xa0Cargle now invites you to acknowledge ways of being that stem from societal expectations instead of your personal truth, and to embark on a renaissance of your own. She provides the very tools and prompts that she used to unearth her own truth, tools that opened her up to being a more authentic feminist and purpose-driven matriarchal leader.\\xa0&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Renaissance of Our Own&lt;/i&gt; gives us the courage to look at the world and say “I want something different.” It serves as a reminder of the power and possibility of reimagining a life that feels right, all the way down to the marrow of your bones.',\n",
